  abstract = {Fixating an emotional facial expression can create afterimages, such that subsequent faces are seen as having the opposite expression of that fixated. Visual afterimages have been used to map the relationships among emotion categories, and this method was used here to compare ASD and matched control participants. Participants adapted to a facial expression for 45 s then saw a neutral face for 800 ms and chose a label to describe the latter. The ASD group showed evidence of afterimages, but atypical patterns of opposition: whereas fixating negative emotions uniformly evokes a positive afterimage in the control group, fixating negative emotions was more likely to evoke a negative afterimage in the ASD group. This study was the first to provide evidence of visual aftereffects in ASD and suggests a different psychological organization among emotions in those with ASD.},

  abstract = {Summary
In low-level vision, exquisite sensitivity to variation in luminance is achieved by adaptive mechanisms that adjust neural sensitivity to the prevailing luminance level. In high-level vision, adaptive mechanisms contribute to our remarkable ability to distinguish thousands of similar faces [1]. A clear example of this sort of adaptive coding is the face-identity aftereffect [2\textendash{}5], in which adaptation to a particular face biases perception toward the opposite identity. Here we investigated face adaptation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by asking them to discriminate between two face identities, with and without prior adaptation to opposite-identity faces. The ASD group discriminated the identities with the same precision as did the age- and ability-matched control group, showing that face identification per se was unimpaired. However, children with ASD showed significantly less adaptation than did their typical peers, with the amount of adaptation correlating significantly with current symptomatology, and face aftereffects of children with elevated symptoms only one third those of controls. These results show that although children with ASD can learn a simple discrimination between two identities, adaptive face-coding mechanisms are severely compromised, offering a new explanation for previously reported face-perception difficulties [6\textendash{}8] and possibly for some of the core social deficits in ASD [9, 10].},

  abstract = {Background
Atypical sensory processing is a common clinical observation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neural hyperexcitability has been suggested as the cause for sensory hypersensitivity, a frequently reported clinical observation in ASD. We examined visual evoked responses to parametric increases in stimulus contrast in order to model neural responsivity of sensory systems in ASD.

Methods
Thirteen high-functioning individuals with ASD and 12 typically developing (TD) individuals completed a steady-state visual evoked potential study. Stimuli were vertical circular gratings oscillating at 3.76~Hz at varying contrasts (5, 10, 20,\ldots, 90~\% contrast, 10 levels). The average spectral power at the stimulus oscillation frequency was calculated for each contrast level.

Results
The magnitude of evoked sensory responses increased at a significantly greater rate and resulted in disproportionately elevated activation with higher contrasts in the ASD group. Approximately 45~\% of ASD participants had rates of response increases greater than any TD participant. This alteration was highly associated with parental reports of these participants' sensory difficulties.

Conclusions
Greater increases in visual responses over contrast manipulation suggest heightened excitability in the sensory cortex in ASD participants. Heightened neural excitability was observed in a substantial portion but not all of the ASD participants. This pattern suggests that individuals with higher excitability may constitute a neurobiologically distinct subgroup requiring individualized treatment interventions.},

  abstract = {Summary
Mental imagery has been proposed to contribute to a variety of high-level cognitive functions, including memory encoding and retrieval, navigation, spatial planning, and even social communication and language comprehension [1\textendash{}5]. However, it is debated whether mental imagery relies on the same sensory representations as perception [1, 6\textendash{}10], and if so, what functional consequences such an overlap might have on perception itself. We report novel evidence that single instances of imagery can have a pronounced facilitatory influence on subsequent conscious perception. Either seeing or imagining a specific pattern could strongly bias which of two competing stimuli reach awareness during binocular rivalry. Effects of imagery and perception were location and orientation specific, accumulated in strength over time, and survived an intervening visual task lasting several seconds prior to presentation of the rivalry display. Interestingly, effects of imagery differed from those of feature-based attention. The results demonstrate that imagery, in the absence of any incoming visual signals, leads to the formation of a short-term sensory trace that can bias future perception, suggesting a means by which high-level processes that support imagination and memory retrieval may shape low-level sensory representations.},

We tested whether perceptual reversals depend on working memory by manipulating its load while the participants were viewing the Necker cube. Increasing working memory load delayed the latency and decreased the frequency of reversals. These effects followed a linear function of load. The findings imply shared resources of the mechanisms responsible for perceptual reversals and working memory maintenance. However, reversals were not completely abolished even with the hard seven-consonants load, suggesting that bottom-up processes continue to operate in the bistable perception dynamics when top-down mechanisms are attenuated.},

  abstract = {Autism is characterized by qualitative abnormalities in behavior and higher order cognitive functions. Minicolumnar irregularities observed in autism provide a neurologically sound localization to observed clinical and anatomical abnormalities. This study corroborates the initial reports of a minicolumnopathy in autism within an independent sample. The patient population consisted of six age-matched pairs of patients (DSM-IV-TR and ADI-R diagnosed) and controls. Digital micrographs were taken from cortical areas S1, 4, 9, and 17. The image analysis produced estimates of minicolumnar width (CW), mean interneuronal distance, variability in CW (V (CW)), cross section of Nissl-stained somata, boundary length of stained somata per unit area, and the planar convexity. On average CW was 27.2 microm in controls and 25.7 microm in autistic patients (P = 0.0234). Mean neuron and nucleolar cross sections were found to be smaller in autistic cases compared to controls, while neuron density in autism exceeded the comparison group by 23\%. Analysis of inter- and intracluster distances of a Delaunay triangulation suggests that the increased cell density is the result of a greater number of minicolumns, otherwise the number of cells per minicolumns appears normal. A reduction in both somatic and nucleolar cross sections could reflect a bias towards shorter connecting fibers, which favors local computation at the expense of inter-areal and callosal connectivity.},

  abstract = {People with schizophrenia (SZ) exhibit deficits in visual processing, including markedly poor detection of extended contours. Although this has been attributed to a deficit in binding or global integration \textendash{} i.e. an inability to pool local structure across space \textendash{} here we present evidence that it likely originates from a combination of poorer local processing (in this case, of orientation) combined with abnormal processing of visual context. We first report that although patients are poorer at detecting contours embedded in random noise they are proportionally less disrupted by the presence of near-parallel surrounds than healthy controls (consistent with earlier reports of reduced surround suppression in SZ). Second we show that patients' ability to report the orientation of the local components of these contour patterns is (a) poor and (b) also less affected by the disruptive influence of distractor elements (visual crowding). We suggest that reduced sensitivity to local orientation, and to orientation-context, could result from abnormal gain control which is implicated both in the generation of orientation-tuning in visual cortex and in surround suppression.

  abstract = {When multistable displays (stimuli consistent with two or more equally plausible perceptual interpretations) are presented intermittently, their perceptions are stabilized by sensory memory. Independent memory traces are generated not only for different types of multistable displays (Maier, Wilke, Logothetis, \& Leopold, Current Biology 13:1076\textendash{}1085, 2003), but also for different ambiguous features of binocular rivalry (Pearson \& Clifford, Journal of Vision 4:196\textendash{}202, 2004). In the present study, we examined whether a similar independence of sensory memories is observed in structure-from-motion (SFM), a multistable display with two ambiguous properties. In SFM, a 2-D planar motion creates a vivid impression of a rotating 3-D volume. Both the illusory rotation and illusory depth (i.e., how close parts of an object appear to the observer) of an SFM object are ambiguous. We dissociated the sensory memories of these two ambiguous properties by using an intermittent presentation in combination with a forced-ambiguous-switch paradigm (Pastukhov, Vonau, \& Braun, PLoS ONE 7:e37734, 2012). We demonstrated that the illusory depth of SFM generates a sensory memory trace that is independent from that of illusory rotation. Despite this independence, the specificities levels of the sensory memories were identical for illusory depth and illusory rotation. The history effect was weakened by a change in the volumetric property of a shape (whether it was a hollow band or a filled drum volume), but not by changes in color or size. We discuss how these new results constrain models of sensory memory and SFM processing.},

These findings reveal that abnormally unreliable cortical responses, even to elementary nonsocial sensory stimuli, may represent a fundamental physiological alteration of neural processing in autism.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the GABA(A) receptor in the autistic brain, we performed (123)I-IMZ SPECT in patients with ASD. We compared (123)I-IMZ SPECT abnormalities in patients who showed intellectual disturbance or focal epileptic discharge on EEG to those in patients without such findings.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 24 patients with ASD (mean age, 7.3$\pm$3.5 years), including 9 with autistic disorder (mean age, 7.0$\pm$3.7 years) and 15 with Asperger's disorder (mean age, 7.5$\pm$3.2 years). We used 10 non-symptomatic partial epilepsy patients (mean age, 7.8$\pm$3.6 years) without intellectual delay as a control group. For an objective evaluation of the (123)I-IMZ SPECT results, we performed an SEE (Stereotactic Extraction Estimation) analysis to describe the decrease in accumulation in each brain lobule numerically.
RESULTS: In the comparison of the ASD group and the control group, there was a dramatic decrease in the accumulation of (123)I-IMZ in the superior and medial frontal cortex. In the group with intellectual impairment and focal epileptic discharge on EEG, the decrease in accumulation in the superior and medial frontal cortex was greater than that in the group without these findings.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that disturbance of the GABAergic nervous system may contribute to the pathophysiology and aggravation of ASD, since the accumulation of (123)I-IMZ was decreased in the superior and medial frontal cortex, which is considered to be associated with inference of the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others (Theory of Mind).},

Secondly, whether differences in EFT performance are related to enhanced local processing or reduced global processing in the ventral visual stream was also examined. Results indicated that people who scored high on the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) were faster to identify embedded figures, and had poorer global motion and global form thresholds than low AQ scorers. However, the two groups did not differ on a task assessing lower-level input to the ventral stream. Overall the results indicate that individuals with high levels of autistic-like traits have difficulties with global integration in the visual pathways, which may at least partly explain their superior EFT performance.},

To elucidate synaptic mechanisms of decision making, I investigated a biophysically realistic cortical network model for a visual discrimination experiment. In the model, slow recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition produce attractor dynamics that amplify the difference between conflicting inputs and generates a binary choice. The model is shown to account for salient characteristics of the observed decision-correlated neural activity, as well as the animal's psychometric function and reaction times. These results suggest that recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA receptors provides a candidate cellular mechanism for the slow time integration of sensory stimuli and the formation of categorical choices in a decision-making neocortical network.},

  abstract = {During binocular rivalry, incompatible images presented dichoptically compete for perceptual dominance. It has long been debated whether binocular rivalry can be controlled by attention. Most studies have shown that voluntary control over binocular rivalry is limited. We sought to remove attention from binocular rivalry by presenting a concurrent task. Diverting attention slowed the rivalry alternation rate, and did so in proportion to the difficulty of the concurrent task. Even a very demanding distractor task, however, did not arrest rivalry alternations completely. Given that diverting attention was equivalent to lowering the contrast of the rival stimuli, the ability of attention to speed binocular rivalry is most likely due to an increase in the effective contrast of the stimuli through boosting the gain of the cortical response. This increase in effective contrast will ultimately lead to a perceptual switch, thereby limiting voluntary control. Thus, attention speeds rivalry alternations, but has no inherent control over the rivalry process.},

Changes in microglial morphology and gene expression have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, it remains unknown whether these changes are a primary cause or a secondary consequence of neuronal deficits. Here we tested whether a primary deficit in microglia was sufficient to induce some autism-related behavioral and functional connectivity deficits. Mice lacking the chemokine receptor Cx3cr1 exhibit a transient reduction of microglia during the early postnatal period and a consequent deficit in synaptic pruning. We show that deficient synaptic pruning is associated with weak synaptic transmission, decreased functional brain connectivity, deficits in social interaction and increased repetitive-behavior phenotypes that have been previously associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings open the possibility that disruptions in microglia-mediated synaptic pruning could contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

But autism can affect behavior in other important and debilitating ways, such as in an intense desire for sameness and in sensory systems that work too well or not well enough. Researchers have largely overlooked the latter ``sensory symptoms,'' but their prominence in forthcoming diagnostic criteria calls for systematic investigation. In this article, I review existing theoretical accounts of autism and provide an overview of a new theoretical account that proposes using Bayesian methods to identify the nature of the (altered) computations involved in autistic sensation and perception. Specifically, the account suggests that sensory symptoms may be due to fewer prior constraints or attenuated ``priors.'' The possibility that autistic people perceive the world as it really is rather than as imbued by prior experiences may explain the range and idiosyncrasy of their sensory sensitivities and their difficulties dealing with new experiences.},

The switch is influenced by the neuronal chloride concentration. When the neuronal chloride concentration is at a high level, GABA acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter. When neuronal chloride concentration decreases to some degree, GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The neuronal chloride concentration is increased by Na+-K+-Cl--Cl- cotransporters 1 (NKCC1), and decreased by K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2).},

The data reported here illustrate that trial-by-trial variability can be reliably measured from EEG, and that intra-participant EEG variability is significantly greater in those with ASD than in neuro-typical matched controls. EEG recorded at the scalp is a linear mixture of activity arising from muscle artifacts and numerous concurrent brain processes. To minimize these additional sources of variability, EEG data were subjected to two different methods of spatial filtering. (i) The data were decomposed using infomax independent component analysis, a method of blind source separation which un-mixes the EEG signal into components with maximally independent time-courses, and (ii) a surface Laplacian transform was performed (current source density interpolation) in order to reduce the effects of volume conduction. Data are presented from 13 high functioning adolescents with ASD without co-morbid ADHD, and 12 neuro-typical age-, IQ-, and gender-matched controls. Comparison of variability between the ASD and neuro-typical groups indicated that intra-participant variability of P1 latency and P1 amplitude was greater in the participants with ASD, and inter-trial $\alpha$-band phase coherence was lower in the participants with ASD. These data support the suggestion that individuals with ASD are less able to synchronize the activity of stimulus-related cell assemblies than neuro-typical individuals, and provide empirical evidence in support of theories of increased neural noise in ASD.},

In the mentalizing and facial emotion perception domain, males and females with ASC showed similar deficits compared to neurotypical controls. However, in attention to detail and dexterity involving executive function, although males with ASC showed poorer performance relative to neurotypical males, females with ASC performed comparably to neurotypical females. We conclude that performance in the social-cognitive domain is equally impaired in male and female adults with ASC. However, in specific non-social cognitive domains, performance within ASC depends on sex. This suggests that in specific domains, cognitive profiles in ASC are modulated by sex.},

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with a detail-oriented perception and overselective attention in visual tasks, such as visual search and crowding. These results were obtained manipulating exclusively the spatial properties of the stimuli: few is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual processing in ASD. In this study we employed an attentional masking (AM) paradigm comparing children with ASD and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls. The AM effect refers to an impaired identification of a target followed by a competitive masking object at different proximities in space and time. We found that ASD and TD groups did not differ in the AM effect provoked by the competitive object displayed in the same position of the target. In contrast, children with ASD showed a deeper and prolonged interference than the TD group when the masking object was displayed in the lateral position. These psychophysical results suggest that the inefficient attentional selection in ASD depends on the spatio-temporal interaction between competitive visual objects. These evidence are discussed in the light of the ASD altered neural connectivity hypothesis and the reentrant theory of perception.},

  abstract = {Summary
Experience-driven neuronal plasticity allows the brain to adapt its functional connectivity to recent sensory input. Here we use binocular rivalry [1], an experimental paradigm in which conflicting images are presented to the individual eyes, to demonstrate plasticity in the neuronal mechanisms that convert visual information from two separated retinas into single perceptual experiences. Perception during binocular rivalry tended to initially consist of alternations between exclusive representations of monocularly defined images, but upon prolonged exposure, mixture percepts became more prevalent. The completeness of suppression, reflected in the incidence of mixture percepts, plausibly reflects the strength of inhibition that likely plays a role in binocular rivalry [2]. Recovery of exclusivity was possible but required highly specific binocular stimulation. Documenting the prerequisites for these observed changes in perceptual exclusivity, our experiments suggest experience-driven plasticity at interocular inhibitory synapses, driven by the correlated activity (and also the lack thereof) of neurons representing the conflicting stimuli. This form of plasticity is consistent with a previously proposed but largely untested anti-Hebbian learning mechanism for inhibitory synapses in vision [3, 4]. Our results implicate experience-driven plasticity as one governing principle in the neuronal organization of binocular vision.},

This is surprising, as many of the higher-level visual differences found in autism have been shown to correlate with autistic traits in non-clinical samples. Here we measure vertical-oblique and, more difficult, oblique-oblique orientation discrimination thresholds in a non-clinical sample. As predicted, oblique-oblique thresholds provided a more sensitive test of orientation discrimination, and were negatively related to autistic traits (N~=~94, r~=~-.356, p~$<$~.0001). We conclude that individual differences in orientation discrimination and autistic traits are related, and suggest that both of these factors could be mediated by increased levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that subjective disappearance of visual stimuli results from a spontaneous reduction of microsaccade rate causing image stabilization, enhanced adaptation, and a consequent fading. In motion-induced blindness (MIB), salient visual targets disappear intermittently when surrounded by a moving pattern. We investigated whether changes in microsaccade rate can account for MIB. We first determined that the moving mask does not affect microsaccade metrics (rate, magnitude, and temporal distribution). We then compared the dynamics of microsaccades during reported illusory disappearance (MIB) and physical disappearance (Replay) of a salient peripheral target. We found large modulations of microsaccade rate following perceptual transitions, whether illusory (MIB) or real (Replay). For MIB, the rate also decreased prior to disappearance and increased prior to reappearance. Importantly, MIB persisted in the presence of microsaccades although sustained microsaccade rate was lower during invisible than visible periods. These results suggest that the microsaccade system reacts to changes in visibility, but microsaccades also modulate MIB. The latter modulation is well described by a Poisson model of the perceptual transitions assuming that the probability for reappearance and disappearance is modulated following a microsaccade. Our results show that microsaccades counteract disappearance but are neither necessary nor sufficient to account for MIB.},

This phenomenon, known as binocular rivalry, has been used as a powerful tool to investigate conscious visual awareness. Of clinical relevance, Pettigrew and Miller (Proc Biol Sci 1998; 265: 2141-2148) found slow perceptual alternation rates in patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I). For a better understanding of differences between BD-I and bipolar II disorder (BD-II), we examined whether perceptual alternation rates of binocular rivalry differ between the two subtypes of bipolar disorder. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The subjects comprised 25 healthy controls, 11 patients with BD-I, and 17 patients with BD-II. They underwent binocular rivalry examination. One-way analysis of variance was conducted to determine differences in the phase duration of binocular rivalry between the control, BD-I, and BD-II groups. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Significant differences were observed in the mean phase duration of binocular rivalry between the groups. Although the medication administered did not differ significantly between the BD-I and BD-II patients, the phase duration was significantly longer among the BD-I patients than the BD-II patients and controls, whereas no significant difference was observed in the phase duration between the BD-II patients and controls. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The present results reveal a significant difference in the mean phase duration of binocular rivalry between subjects with BD-I and those with BD-II, suggesting the presence of some neurobiological difference between these two subtypes of bipolar disorder.},

We recently measured effects of attention [7] on the phenomenon of lateral interactions between collinear elements [8, 9], commonly thought to reflect long-range mechanisms in early visual cortex [10\textendash{}15] underlying contour integration [16]. We showed improved detection of low-contrast central Gabor targets in the context of collinear flankers, but only when the collinear flankers were attended for a secondary task rather than ignored in favor of an orthogonal flanker pair. Here, we contrast two hypotheses for how attention might modulate flanker influences on the target: by changing just local sensitivity to the flankers themselves (flanker-modulation-only hypothesis), or by weighting integrative connections between flanker and target (connection-weighting hypothesis). Modeled on the known nonlinear dependence of target visibility on collinear flanker contrast [17\textendash{}21], the first hypothesis predicts that an increase in physical flanker contrast should readily offset any reduction in their effective contrast when ignored, thus eliminating attentional modulation. Conversely, the second hypothesis predicts that attentional modulation should persist even for the highest flanker contrasts. Our results showed the latter outcome and indicated that attention modulates flanker-target integration, rather than just processing of local flanker elements.},

Consequently, visual cortical neurons need to have the flexibility to encode visual features under both monocular and binocular situations. Here we show that binocular orientation selectivity of mouse simple cells is nearly identical to monocular orientation selectivity in both anaesthetized and awake conditions. In vivo whole-cell recordings reveal that the binocular integration of membrane potential responses is sublinear. The sublinear integration keeps binocularly evoked depolarizations below threshold at non-preferred orientations, thus preserving orientation selectivity. Computational simulations based on measured synaptic conductances indicate that inhibition promotes sublinear binocular integration, which are further confirmed by experiments using genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Our findings therefore reveal a cellular mechanism for how visual system can switch effortlessly between monocular and binocular conditions. The same mechanism may apply to other sensory systems that also integrate multiple channels of inputs.},

  abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of complex genetics, characterized by impairment in social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behavior. Multiple lines of evidence, including alterations in levels of GABA and GABA receptors in autistic patients, indicate that the GABAergic system, which is responsible for synaptic inhibition in the adult brain, may be involved in autism. Previous studies in our lab indicated association of noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a GABA receptor subunit gene on chromosome 4, GABRA4, and interaction between SNPs in GABRA4 and GABRB1 (also on chromosome 4), within Caucasian autism patients. Studies of genetic variation in African-American autism families are rare. Analysis of 557 Caucasian and an independent population of 54 African-American families with 35 SNPs within GABRB1 and GABRA4 strengthened the evidence for involvement of GABRA4 in autism risk in Caucasians (rs17599165, p=0.0015; rs1912960, p=0.0073; and rs17599416, p=0.0040) and gave evidence of significant association in African-Americans (rs2280073, p=0.0287 and rs16859788, p=0.0253). The GABRA4 and GABRB1 interaction was also confirmed in the Caucasian dataset (most significant pair, rs1912960 and rs2351299; p=0.004). Analysis of the subset of families with a positive history of seizure activity in at least one autism patient revealed no association to GABRA4; however, three SNPs within GABRB1 showed significant allelic association; rs2351299 (p=0.0163), rs4482737 (p=0.0339), and rs3832300 (p=0.0253). These results confirmed our earlier findings, indicating GABRA4 and GABRB1 as genes contributing to autism susceptibility, extending the effect to multiple ethnic groups and suggesting seizures as a stratifying phenotype.},

Cognition, 50, 115-132) argue that individuals with autism exhibit 'weak central coherence': an inability to integrate elements of information into coherent wholes. Some authors have speculated that a high-level impairment might be present in the dorsal visual pathway in autism, and furthermore, that this might account for weak central coherence, at least at the visuospatial level. We assessed the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway in children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and in typically developing children, using two visual tasks, one examining functioning at higher levels of the dorsal cortical stream (Global Dot Motion (GDM)), and the other assessing lower-level dorsal stream functioning (Flicker Contrast Sensitivity (FCS)). Central coherence was tested using the Children's Embedded Figures Test (CEFT). Relative to the typically developing children, the children with ASD had shorter CEFT latencies and higher GDM thresholds but equivalent FCS thresholds. Additionally, CEFT latencies were inversely related to GDM thresholds in the ASD group. These outcomes indicate that the elevated global motion thresholds in autism are the result of high-level impairments in dorsal cortical regions. Weak visuospatial coherence in autism may be in the form of abnormal cooperative mechanisms in extra-striate cortical areas, which might contribute to differential performance when processing stimuli as Gestalts, including both dynamic (i.e., global motion perception) and static (i.e., disembedding performance) stimuli.},

  abstract = {How we attend to objects and their features that cannot be separated by location is not understood. We presented two temporally and spatially overlapping streams of objects, faces versus houses, and used magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to separate neuronal responses to attended and unattended objects. Attention to faces versus houses enhanced the sensory responses in the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA), respectively. The increases in sensory responses were accompanied by induced gamma synchrony between the inferior frontal junction, IFJ, and either FFA or PPA, depending on which object was attended. The IFJ appeared to be the driver of the synchrony, as gamma phases were advanced by 20 ms in IFJ compared to FFA or PPA. Thus, the IFJ may direct the flow of visual processing during object-based attention, at least in part through coupled oscillations with specialized areas such as FFA and PPA.
House or Face?
The neural mechanisms of spatial attention are well known, unlike nonspatial attention. Baldauf and Desimone (p. 424, published online 10 April) combined several technologies to identify a fronto-temporal network in humans that mediates nonspatial object-based attention. There is a clear top-down directionality of these oscillatory interactions, establishing the inferior-frontal cortex as a key source of nonspatial attentional inputs to the inferior-temporal cortex. Surprisingly, the mechanisms for nonspatial attention are strikingly parallel to the mechanisms of spatial attention.},

  doi = {10.1167/4.7.2},
  abstract = {It is debated whether different forms of bistable perception result from common or separate neural mechanisms. Binocular rivalry involves perceptual alternations between competing monocular images, whereas ambiguous figures such as the Necker cube lead to alternations between two possible pictorial interpretations. Previous studies have shown that observers can voluntarily control the alternation rate of both rivalry and Necker cube reversal, perhaps suggesting that bistable perception results from a common mechanism of top-down selection. However, according to the biased competition model of selective attention, attention should be able to enhance the attended percept and suppress the unattended percept. Here, we investigated selective attentional modulation of dominance durations in bistable perception. Observers consistently showed much weaker selective attentional control for rivalry than for Necker cube reversal, even for rivalry displays that maximized the opportunities for feature-, object-, or space-based attentional selection. In contrast, nonselective control of alternation rate was comparably strong for both forms of bistable perception and corresponded poorly with estimates of selective attentional control. Our results support the notion that binocular rivalry involves a more automatic, stimulus-driven form of visual competition than Necker cube reversal, and as a consequence, is less easily biased by selective attention.},

  abstract = {Under conditions in which the visual system cannot reconcile dissimilar images from the two eyes, perception typically alternates between the two half-images-a process known as binocular rivalry. We report a real-time, steady-state VEP method that is a sensitive detector of the continuous alternations in perceptual dominance across the eyes. This method works by labeling each half-image with a slightly different temporal frequency so that the record generated by each can be recovered from the EEG by spectrum analysis. In this way, one can track the ``waxing'' and ``waning'' of the VEP amplitudes for each eye simultaneously during spontaneous rivalry, permitting an analysis of the relative physiological dominance of each eye in real-time. Such alternations were clearly observed in the VEP amplitudes generated by each half-image during rivalry (the amplitudes for the two eyes correlated negatively). In contrast, VEP amplitudes for the two eyes varied either synchronously or randomly when the half-images were allowed to fuse. The instances of physiological dominance of each eye as evidenced by the VEP correlated well with the subjects' report of perceptual dominance. This purely electrophysiological method appears to be suitable for measuring rivalry in non-verbal human or animal subjects, as it does not require active participation from them.},

  abstract = {Unless we fixate directly on it, it is hard to see an object among other objects. This breakdown in object recognition, called crowding, severely limits peripheral vision. The effect is more severe when objects are more similar. When observers mistake the identity of a target among flanker objects, they often report a flanker. Many have taken these flanker reports as evidence of internal substitution of the target by a flanker. Here, we ask observers to identify a target letter presented in between one similar and one dissimilar flanker letter. Simple substitution takes in only one letter, which is often the target but, by unwitting mistake, is sometimes a flanker. The opposite of substitution is pooling, which takes in more than one letter. Having taken only one letter, the substitution process knows only its identity, not its similarity to the target. Thus, it must report similar and dissimilar flankers equally often. Contrary to this prediction, the similar flanker is reported much more often than the dissimilar flanker, showing that rampant flanker substitution cannot account for most flanker reports. Mixture modeling shows that simple substitution can account for, at most, about half the trials. Pooling and nonpooling (simple substitution) together include all possible models of crowding. When observers are asked to identify a crowded object, at least half of their reports are pooled, based on a combination of information from target and flankers, rather than being based on a single letter.},

activity. A technique to implement BCIs, used recently also in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, is based on
the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) detection. Exploiting the SSVEP response, BCIs could
be implemented showing targets flickering at different frequencies and detecting which is gazed by the observer
analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this work, we evaluate the use of stereoscopic
displays for the presentation of SSVEP eliciting stimuli, comparing their effectiveness between monoscopic and
stereoscopic stimuli. Moreover we propose a novel method to elicit SSVEP responses exploiting the stereoscopic
displays capability of presenting dichoptic stimuli. We have created an experimental scene to present flickering
stimuli on an active stereoscopic display, obtaining reliable control of the targets' frequency independently for
the two stereo views. Using an EEG acquisition device, we analyzed the SSVEP responses from a group of
subjects. From the preliminary results, we got evidence that stereoscopic displays represent valid devices for the
presentation of SSVEP stimuli. Moreover, the use of different flickering frequencies for the two views of a single
stimulus proved to elicit non-linear interactions between the stimulation frequencies, clearly visible in the EEG
signal. This suggests interesting applications for SSVEP-based BCIs in VR environments able to overcome some
limitations imposed by the refresh frequency of standard displays, but also the use of commodity stereoscopic
displays to implement binocular rivalry experiments.},

  abstract = {Reports of reduced susceptibility to visual illusions in autistic individuals
have generally been attributed to differences at the level of the percept. However,
group differences could instead refl ect differences in higher-level decision-making
strategies. Here, we measured the perceptual biases of 28 children
with autism aged 6 to 14 years and 32 age- and ability-matched typical
children using a 2-alternative-forced-choice method with a roving pedestal
designed to minimise response and decision biases (Morgan, Melmoth \&
Solomon, 2013, Visual Neuroscience 30:197-206). Children were presented
with a reference stimulus and two comparison stimuli (see Figure 1), and
asked to identify which comparison stimulus had a central circle most similar
in size to that of the reference stimulus. One comparison stimulus was a
pedestal, which had a central circle either 5\% larger or 5\% smaller than the
reference stimulus. The other comparison stimulus had a central circle that
was an increment larger than the pedestal. The pedestal size (+5\%, -5\%) was
randomly interleaved throughout the task, so that children did not know
which of the two comparison stimuli was the pedestal on a given trial. Children
completed this task in two context conditions: with small surrounding

circles on the reference and large surrounding circles on the comparison
stimuli (S-L), and vice versa (L-S; see Figure 1). The data were fi t with a
cumulative normal psychometric function using the maximum likelihood
estimate technique, modelling the effect of context condition as an equivalent
pedestal with no effect on internal noise. Children with autism had
typical levels of internal noise and exhibited a similar degree of perceptual
bias to that of typically developing children. Our results are inconsistent
with theories proposing reduced contextual integration in autism and suggest
that previous reports of reduced susceptibility to illusions arise from
differences in response or decisional criteria, not perceptual differences.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, which encodes the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), cause Rett syndrome and several neurodevelopmental disorders including cognitive disorders, autism, juvenile-onset schizophrenia and encephalopathy with early lethality. Rett syndrome is characterized by apparently normal early development followed by regression, motor abnormalities, seizures and features of autism, especially stereotyped behaviours. The mechanisms mediating these features are poorly understood. Here we show that mice lacking Mecp2 from GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons recapitulate numerous Rett syndrome and autistic features, including repetitive behaviours. Loss of MeCP2 from a subset of forebrain GABAergic neurons also recapitulates many features of Rett syndrome. MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show reduced inhibitory quantal size, consistent with a presynaptic reduction in glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) levels, and GABA immunoreactivity. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of GABA-releasing neurons and that subtle dysfunction of GABAergic neurons contributes to numerous neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

  abstract = {This paper presents results from psychophysical experiments on human binocular rivalry in central and peripheral vision. Results show that the incidence of periods of exclusive visibility of a given eye's rival target increased with decreasing target size, and for a given sized target exclusive visibility increased with retinal eccentricity. Control measures confirmed that these results were not attributable solely to reduced peripheral acuity, to Troxler's effect, or to spatial frequency. We computed the minimum-sized stimulus that would lead to a criterion level of exclusive visibility of one or the other eye; this we term the spatial zone of binocular rivalry. The change in estimated size of spatial zones of rivalry with eccentricity compares favorably with estimates of human cortical magnification. We propose a model that assumes concentrically organized zones of rivalry. These zones do not function independently, but instead exhibit a high degree of mutual excitatory cooperativity. The model has multiple solutions for the foveal zone size, but the best fits predict a diameter of 5.3 or 7.3 min of visual angle; these values dovetail nicely with our empirical estimates of the foveal zone size.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most specific method to define epileptogenic cortex. Its sensitivity and specificity depend on several factors such as age and recording procedures, for example, sleep recordings and activation procedures (hyperventilation, photic stimulation). EEG reveals characteristic findings in several epilepsy syndromes. Rarely, epileptiform discharges are recorded in healthy, particularly young individuals. Ictal video/EEG recording is considered to be critical in localizing the epileptogenic zone. A careful analysis of the first clinical signs and symptoms of a seizure and of the evolution of the seizure symptomatology can provide important localizing clues. Although surface EEG recordings are less sensitive than invasive studies, they provide the best overview and, therefore, the most efficient way to define the approximate localization of the epileptogenic zone. Invasive recordings are used in patients in whom the epileptogenic zone either cannot be located with noninvasive diagnostic methods or is adjacent to eloquent cortex. The most commonly used invasive electrodes are stereotactically implanted depth electrodes and subdural strip or grid electrodes. Foramen ovale and epidural electrodes are of intermediate invasiveness, but less sensitive. Invasive electrodes are subject to sampling errors if misplaced and should be used only after exhaustive noninvasive evaluations have (1) failed to localize the epileptogenic zone and (2) led to a testable hypothesis regarding this localization. Invasive EEG studies are associated with additional risks that are justifiable only if there is a good chance of obtaining essential localizing information and on a potentially resectable area.},

Individuals with PDD performed equally with or better than controls on motion detection tasks. In addition, the authors did not find differences on any of the tasks between parents of the PDD group and matched control parents.

One prominent class of influences is called pavlovian\textendash{}instrumental transfer (PIT), in which the motivational characteristics of a predictor influence the vigor of an action with respect to which it is formally completely independent. We provide a demonstration of behavioral PIT in humans, with an audiovisual predictor of the noncontingent delivery of money inducing participants to perform more avidly an action involving squeezing a handgrip to earn money. Furthermore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that this enhanced motivation was associated with a trial-by-trial correlation with the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the nucleus accumbens and a subject-by-subject correlation with the BOLD signal in the amygdala. Our data dovetails well with the animal literature and sheds light on the neural control of vigor.},

  abstract = {Spatial interactions are extensive in the peripheral visual field, extending up to about half the retinal eccentricity of the target (Toet and Levi, Vision Res. 32, 1349-1357, 1992). In the present study it is shown that the degree and extent of peripheral spatial interaction depends in large measure on the similarity between test and flanking stimuli. The stimulus consisted of a test T surrounded by four distracting flanking Ts, each randomly oriented. The task was to determine the orientation of the test T. The test and flanking Ts differed in contrast polarity, shape, depth, color, eye of origin, or contrast. When the target and flanks differed in contrast polarity, depth, or shape, performance improved markedly for all observers. A color difference enhanced the performance of most but not all observers. Eye-of-origin had no effect, that is, spatial interaction was identical when the target and flanks were presented to the same eye, or to opposite eyes. The role of stimulus duration in spatial interaction was examined in two additional experiments. In the first, the stimulus viewing duration was increased in order to allow the observer time to serially search for the test T. In the second experiment, a postmask was presented at the location of the test T. The results of these experiments showed that the influence of similarity was independent of stimulus duration and the postmask, and suggest that serial search does not play an important role in the spatial interaction effects reported here. The extent of spatial interaction is correlated with the ability to do parallel search.},

  abstract = {Visual crowding is the inability to identify visible features when they are surrounded by other structure in the peripheral field. Since natural environments are replete with structure and most of our visual field is peripheral, crowding represents the primary limit on vision in the real world. However, little is known about the characteristics of crowding under natural conditions. Here we examine where crowding occurs in natural images. Observers were required to identify which of four locations contained a patch of ``dead leaves'' (synthetic, naturalistic contour structure) embedded into natural images. Threshold size for the dead leaves patch scaled with eccentricity in a manner consistent with crowding. Reverse correlation at multiple scales was used to determine local image statistics that correlated with task performance. Stepwise model selection revealed that local RMS contrast and edge density at the site of the dead leaves patch were of primary importance in predicting the occurrence of crowding once patch size and eccentricity had been considered. The absolute magnitudes of the regression weights for RMS contrast at different spatial scales varied in a manner consistent with receptive field sizes measured in striate cortex of primate brains. Our results are consistent with crowding models that are based on spatial averaging of features in the early stages of the visual system, and allow the prediction of where crowding is likely to occur in natural images.},

Using this procedure, we showed that paying attention to the stimulus features involved in rivalry is necessary for prolonging dominance durations\textemdash{}mere engagement of attention during rivalry was insufficient. Finally, we were able to simulate the effects of endogenous attention by doubling the contrast of the attended stimulus while it was dominant.

  volume = {77},
  issn = {0002-9297},
  abstract = {Autism is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a significant genetic component. Existing research suggests that multiple genes contribute to autism and that epigenetic effects or gene-gene interactions are likely contributors to autism risk. However, these effects have not yet been identified. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has been implicated in autism etiology. Fourteen known autosomal GABA receptor subunit genes were studied to look for the genes associated with autism and their possible interactions. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in the following genes: GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1 on chromosome 4p12; GABRB2, GABRA6, GABRA1, GABRG2, and GABRP on 5q34-q35.1; GABRR1 and GABRR2 on 6q15; and GABRA5, GABRB3, and GABRG3 on 15q12. Intronic and/or silent mutation SNPs within each gene were analyzed in 470 white families with autism. Initially, SNPs were used in a family-based study for allelic association analysis\textemdash{}with the pedigree disequilibrium test and the family-based association test\textemdash{}and for genotypic and haplotypic association analysis\textemdash{}with the genotype-pedigree disequilibrium test (geno-PDT), the association in the presence of linkage (APL) test, and the haplotype family-based association test. Next, with the use of five refined independent marker sets, extended multifactor-dimensionality reduction (EMDR) analysis was employed to identify the models with locus joint effects, and interaction was further verified by conditional logistic regression. Significant allelic association was found for markers RS1912960 (in GABRA4; P = .01) and HCV9866022 (in GABRR2; P = .04). The geno-PDT found significant genotypic association for HCV8262334 (in GABRA2), RS1912960 and RS2280073 (in GABRA4), and RS2617503 and RS12187676 (in GABRB2). Consistent with the allelic and genotypic association results, EMDR confirmed the main effect at RS1912960 (in GABRA4). EMDR also identified a significant two-locus gene-gene effect model involving RS1912960 in GABRA4 and RS2351299 in GABRB1. Further support for this two-locus model came from both the multilocus geno-PDT and the APL test, which indicated a common genotype and haplotype combination positively associated with disease. Finally, these results were also consistent with the results from the conditional logistic regression, which confirmed the interaction between GABRA4 and GABRB1 (odds ratio = 2.9 for interaction term; P = .002). Through the convergence of all analyses, we conclude that GABRA4 is involved in the etiology of autism and potentially increases autism risk through interaction with GABRB1. These results support the hypothesis that GABA receptor subunit genes are involved in autism, most likely via complex gene-gene interactions.},

Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3\textendash{}11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P$<$0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P$<$0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean$\pm$s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0\textendash{}3.5 mM l-1 K+) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism. Larger trials are warranted to better determine the population best suited for this treatment.},

  abstract = {Background:  Although defects in social and communicative functioning are the most obvious features in autistic children, there is evidence suggesting that unusual perceptual processing is at least a concomitant and possible cause of many of the behavioral signs and symptoms of autism spectrum. In the present study, the perceptual integration of autistic children was studied. These processes require perceptual coherence in visual structure in a holistic manner.    Methods:  25 high-functioning autistic and 25 neuro-typical boys were assessed in term of visual perceptual processing. Visual stimuli included fragmented (incomplete) and complete object images that were presented in a monitor. The subject's task was rapid and accurate naming of images that were seen. Responses were compared by independent t-test. Also, the effect of completeness factor and group type on the samples' visual processing was analyzed by repeated measure analysis of variance.    Results:  The autistic children had lower function in naming the fragmented picture, however, both groups were equivalent in recognition of the complete image. On the other hand, all subjects in this study performed better in naming the complete images compared with the fragmented images. Also, the interaction effect of image type and group on visual processing was significant.    Conclusion:  Defect in recognition of fragmented images can be indicative of disturbance of processes related to visual perceptual integration in individuals with autism. Detection of these images in autistic children was significantly different from that of normal children, that indicates weakness of processes related to visual completion and perceptual integration.},

  doi = {10.1016/S1388-2457(02)00106-2},
  abstract = {Objectives: The present study aimed to describe the effect of aging on single-trial visual alpha responses.

Methods: Visual evoked potentials were recorded at F3, Cz, P3, and O1 in 12 young (20\textendash{}30-year-olds) and in 10 middle-aged adults (50\textendash{}55-year-olds). Slow (7\textendash{}10 Hz) and fast (10\textendash{}15 Hz) alpha frequency bands were analyzed. Three parameters of single alpha responses were assessed for the 0\textendash{}300 ms period after stimulus: (i) maximal single-sweep amplitude; (ii) phase-locking with stimulus, and (iii) enhancement of post-stimulus relative to pre-stimulus alpha activity.

Results: Ongoing alpha activity at anterior sites was larger in middle-aged subjects. Age differences in response amplitude depended on the anterior shift of ongoing alpha activity. Over fronto-central areas, the phase-locking of fast alpha responses was significantly increased, whereas the phase-locking of slow alpha responses was decreased in middle-aged compared to young adults, independently of amplitude. In contrast to slow alpha responses, frontal and occipital fast alpha responses were interrelated.

Conclusions: These observations are in accordance with previous findings from the auditory modality implying that the age-related changes in frontal alpha oscillations are modality-independent. Slow and fast frontal alpha responses were affected differentially by the age, which might reflect the activations of functionally distinct alpha networks.},

  abstract = {Subunit proteins that make up functional GABAA receptors were localized immunocytochemistry in the primary visual cortex (area 17) of adult monkeys and humans. Immunoreactivity for the alpha 1, beta 2/3, and gamma 2 subunits is greatest in layers (II-III, IVA and IVC) of monkey area 17 that contain the highest density of GABA neurons and terminals. Immunostaining for each subunit is unevenly distributed in layers II and III, where patches of immunoreactivity correspond to regions of intense cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining, and in layer IVA, where intense immunoreactivity forms a honeycomb pattern identical to the CO staining pattern. Immunoreactivity for the subunits is localized principally within the neuropil, which, by simultaneous comparison with the distribution of microtubule-associated protein immunostaining, was found to include bundles of thin dendrites and zones of numerous dendritic segments. In addition, gamma 2 immunostaining surrounds the somata of a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, immunoreactive for the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. All three subunits are present in the somata and processes of neurons that occupy the white matter subjacent to monkey area 17. In human visual cortex, the alpha 1, beta 2/3, and gamma 2 subunits are distributed in a manner similar to that found in monkeys, with relatively intense immunostaining in layers IVC and IVA. In layer IVC, vertical stripes of intense receptor immunostaining (20\textendash{}30 microns wide) alternate with wider stripes of pale immunostaining (30\textendash{}60 microns wide). In the upper and lower halves of IVC beta, these stripes form lattices similar to those in layers IVC and IVA of monkeys. Following monocular deprivation by intravitreal injections of TTX in adult monkeys, immunoreactivity for each subunit in layer IVC consists of alternating intensely and lightly stained stripes. Comparison with the pattern of CO staining indicates that intense immunostaining for alpha 1, beta 2/3, and gamma 2 occurs in normal-eye stripes while abnormally light immunostaining is present in deprived-eye stripes. For all three subunits, immunoreactivity in deprived-eye stripes is reduced within 5 d of monocular deprivation and remains abnormally low for deprivations that extend to at least 30 d. These findings indicate that each of several GABAA receptor subunits adopt similar laminar and compartmental distributions in monkey and human area 17 and are likely to be expressed by the same neurons. The deprivation-dependent reduction in immunoreactivity for alpha 1, beta 2/3, and gamma 2 subunits suggests that all are regulated by visually driven activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Inhibition at the second synaptic level (in the inner retina) is thought to mediate more complex response properties. Here we show that much of the sustained surround antagonism in certain on-center ganglion cells results from lateral inhibition in the inner retina, via GABAergic amacrine cells, and that the lateral conduction of this signal requires voltage-gated sodium currents. Blocking lateral inhibition in the inner retina eliminates the preference of small-center ganglion cells for small stimuli but has little effect on ganglion cells with large receptive-field centers. These results illustrate how lateral inhibition at successive synaptic stages can selectively control the size of neural receptive-field centers.},

When targets were separated by less than 700 ms, steady- state brain electrical response in both hemispheres was augmented and background EEG decreased for rightward shifts as compared with leftward shifts. At longer separations, persons with autism showed no modulation of background EEG, and high variability in steady-state response. These results contrast with those in normal controls, where in each hemisphere separately steady-state response increased and background EEG descreased for shifts directed contralaterally to that hemisphere. Group differences were significant at p $<$ 0.04 for the steady-state response and p $<$ 0.0001 for the background EEG. Lack of hemispherically independent modulation in autism may reflect the operation of a non-specific mechanism of sensory gating.},

  abstract = {Objective
Visual hyperexcitability in the form of abnormal contrast gain control has been shown in photosensitive epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsies. We assessed the accuracy and reliability of measures of visual contrast gain control in discerning individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsies from healthy controls.
Methods
Twenty-four adult patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and 32 neurotypical control subjects from two study sites participated in a prospective, cross-sectional study. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials to a wide range of contrasts of a flickering grating stimulus. The resultant response magnitude vs. contrast curves were fitted to a standard model of contrast response function, and the model parameters were used as input features to a linear classifier to separate patients from controls. Additionally we compared the relative contribution of model parameters towards the classification using a sparse feature-selection approach.
Results
Classification accuracy was 80\% or better. Sensitivity and specificity both were 80\textendash{}85\%. Cross validation confirmed robust classifier performance generalizable across the data from the two samples. Patients' relative lack of gain control at high contrasts was the most important information distinguishing patients from controls.
Conclusions
Individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy were distinguishable from the neurotypical with a high degree of accuracy and reliability by a reduction in gain control at high contrasts.
Significance
Gain control is an essential neural operation that regulates neuronal sensitivity to stimuli and may represent a novel biomarker of hyperexcitability.},

Although no such theory can offer a comprehensive account, the parsimonious descriptions they provide are powerful catalysts to autism research. One recent proposal holds that `noisy' neuronal signalling explains not only some deficits in autism spectrum disorder, but also some superior abilities, due to `stochastic resonance'. Here, we discuss three distinct actions of noise in neural networks, arguing in each case that autism spectrum disorder symptoms reflect too little, rather than too much, neural noise. Such reduced noise, perhaps a function of atypical brainstem activation, would enhance detection and discrimination in autism spectrum disorder but at significant cost, foregoing the widespread benefits of noise in neural networks.},

  abstract = {Background
Abnormal decision making under risk is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders. Here, we focus on binge drinkers (BD), characterized by repeated episodes of heavy alcohol intoxication. Previous studies suggest a decreased sensitivity to aversive conditioning in BD. Here, we asked whether BD might be characterized by enhanced risk seeking related to decreased sensitivity to the anticipation of negative outcomes.
Methods
Using an anticipatory risk-taking task (40 BD and 70 healthy volunteers) and an adapted version of this task for functional magnetic resonance imaging (21 BD and 21 healthy volunteers), we assessed sensitivity to reward and loss across risk probabilities.
Results
In the behavioral task, BD showed a higher number of risky choices in high-risk losses. In the neuroimaging task, the high-risk attitude in the loss condition was associated with greater activity in dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and superior parietal cortices in BD. Explicit exposure of BD to the probability and magnitude of loss, via introduction of feedback, resulted in a subsequent decrease in risky choices. This change in risk attitude in BD was associated with greater activity in inferior frontal gyrus, which also correlated with the percentage of decrease in risky choices after feedback presentation, suggesting a possible role for cognitive control toward risk-seeking attitudes.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that a decrease in sensitivity to the anticipation of high-risk negative outcomes might underlie BD behavior. Presentation of explicit feedback of probability and loss in BD can potentially modify risk-taking attitudes, which have important public health implications and suggest possible therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Visuo-perceptual processing in autism is characterized by intact or enhanced performance on static spatial tasks and inferior performance on dynamic tasks, suggesting a deficit of dorsal visual stream processing in autism. However, previous findings by Bertone et al. indicate that neuro-integrative mechanisms used to detect complex motion, rather than motion perception per se, may be impaired in autism. We present here the first demonstration of concurrent enhanced and decreased performance in autism on the same visuo-spatial static task, wherein the only factor dichotomizing performance was the neural complexity required to discriminate grating orientation. The ability of persons with autism was found to be superior for identifying the orientation of simple, luminance-defined (or first-order) gratings but inferior for complex, texture-defined (or second-order) gratings. Using a flicker contrast sensitivity task, we demonstrated that this finding is probably not due to abnormal information processing at a sub-cortical level (magnocellular and parvocellular functioning). Together, these findings are interpreted as a clear indication of altered low-level perceptual information processing in autism, and confirm that the deficits and assets observed in autistic visual perception are contingent on the complexity of the neural network required to process a given type of visual stimulus. We suggest that atypical neural connectivity, resulting in enhanced lateral inhibition, may account for both enhanced and decreased low-level information processing in autism.},

One factor that determines perception of such an ambiguous stimulus is how the same stimulus was perceived on previous occasions, a phenomenon called perceptual memory. We examined perceptual memory of an ambiguous motion stimulus while applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the motion-sensitive areas of the middle temporal cortex (hMT+). TMS increased the predominance of whichever perceptual interpretation was most commonly reported by a given observer at baseline, with reduced perception of the less favored interpretation. This increased incidence of the preferred percept indicates impaired long-term buildup of perceptual memory traces that normally act against individual percept biases. We observed no effect on short-term memory traces acting from one presentation to the next. Our results indicate that hMT+ is important for the long-term buildup of perceptual memory for ambiguous motion stimuli.},

This study's purpose was to evaluate autistic children for visual dysfunction that may be related to the manifested visual signs and symptoms. Thirty-four autistic children, ages 2 to 11 years (median age = 7 years, 6 months) were evaluated for ocular alignment, refractive error, visual acuity, oculomotility skills, and stereopsis. None of the children manifested ocular disease, known seizure disorders, or dysmorphic features. Their developmental levels ranged from average intelligence to severely retarded. Binocular visual acuity was measured with the acuity card procedure. Monocular visual acuity was not obtained. Refractive errors ranged from -4.25 to +3.25 D; the median was plano with the near retinoscopy technique. Of the 34 children, 21\% were strabismic at far and 18\% were strabismic at near. Lang stereo testing was attempted on all children and completed on 17. Of the 17, all but 3 exhibited 550 sec arc. Only 14.7\% of the children exhibited voluntary pursuit movements, and all the children demonstrated saccadic fixations. Thirty-one children had atypical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) responses such as delayed onset, short duration, gaze avoidance, or stereotypic behavior. Repeated testing revealed consistent visual responses on OKN and visual acuity. Given these findings, research with this population should be pursued further.},

Across five experiments, we found that motion sequences biased perceptual selection such that a rivalrous stimulus that continued a motion sequence tended to dominate one that did not. However, signals generated by complex pattern of motion information or verbal-semantic information had no influence on selection. These results are consistent with the view that onset rivalry is an early phase of rivalry that is likely insensitive to modulation by factors originating beyond the visual system.},

We report here that in humans such perceptual alternations can be slowed, and even brought to a standstill, if the visual stimulus is periodically removed from view. We also show, with a visual illusion, that this stabilizing effect hinges on perceptual disappearance rather than on actual removal of the stimulus. These findings indicate that uninterrupted subjective perception of an ambiguous pattern is required for the initiation of the brain-state changes underlying multistable vision.},

Neurophysiologic and behavioral evidence rules out motor dysfunction as the cause of this deficit. These findings are consistent with the proposal that in autism cerebellar maldevelopment may contribute to an inability to execute rapid attention shifts, which in turn undermines social and cognitive development. Findings support the proposal that the human cerebellum is involved in the coordination of rapid attention shifts in a fashion analogous to its role in the coordination of movement.

However, many of these studies do not distinguish between early and late phases of rivalry. There is clear evidence that the ``onset'' stage of rivalry is characterized by stable, yet idiosyncratic biases that are not evident in the average dominance of sustained rivalry viewing. Low-level stimulus features also have robust effects in the onset phase that are not seen in sustained rivalry, suggesting these phases may be driven at least partly by different neural mechanisms. The effects of high-level cognitive and affective factors at onset are less clear but also show differences from their effects in sustained viewing. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of any rivalry experiments using brief presentation paradigms and for understanding how the brain copes with binocular discrepancies in natural viewing conditions in which our eyes constantly move around an ever-changing environment. This review will summarize current research and explore the factors influencing this ``onset'' stage.},

  abstract = {Observers continually make unconscious inferences about the state of the world based on ambiguous sensory information. This process of perceptual decision-making may be optimized by learning from experience. We investigated the influence of previous perceptual experience on the interpretation of ambiguous visual information. Observers were pre-exposed to a perceptually stabilized sequence of an ambiguous structure-from-motion stimulus by means of intermittent presentation. At the subsequent re-appearance of the same ambiguous stimulus perception was initially biased toward the previously stabilized perceptual interpretation. However, prolonged viewing revealed a bias toward the alternative perceptual interpretation. The prevalence of the alternative percept during ongoing viewing was largely due to increased durations of this percept, as there was no reliable decrease in the durations of the pre-exposed percept. Moreover, the duration of the alternative percept was modulated by the specific characteristics of the pre-exposure, whereas the durations of the pre-exposed percept were not. The increase in duration of the alternative percept was larger when the pre-exposure had lasted longer and was larger after ambiguous pre-exposure than after unambiguous pre-exposure. Using a binocular rivalry stimulus we found analogous perceptual biases, while pre-exposure did not affect eye-bias. We conclude that previously perceived interpretations dominate at the onset of ambiguous sensory information, whereas alternative interpretations dominate prolonged viewing. Thus, at first instance ambiguous information seems to be judged using familiar percepts, while re-evaluation later on allows for alternative interpretations.},

  abstract = {Phase information is a fundamental aspect of visual stimuli. However, the nature of the binocular combination of stimuli defined by modulations in contrast, so-called second-order stimuli, is presently not clear. To address this issue, we measured binocular combination for first- (luminance modulated) and second-order (contrast modulated) stimuli using a binocular phase combination paradigm in seven normal adults. We found that the binocular perceived phase of second-order gratings depends on the interocular signal ratio as has been previously shown for their first order counterparts; the interocular signal ratios when the two eyes were balanced was close to 1 in both first- and second-order phase combinations. However, second-order combination is more linear than previously found for first-order combination. Furthermore, binocular combination of second-order stimuli was similar regardless of whether the carriers in the two eyes were correlated, anti-correlated, or uncorrelated. This suggests that, in normal adults, the binocular phase combination of second-order stimuli occurs after the monocular extracting of the second-order modulations. The sensory balance associated with this second-order combination can be obtained from binocular phase combination measurements.},

We review those studies that have been unable to identify the locus of the mechanisms that may be responsible for weak central coherence effects and those that show that local processing is enhanced in autism but not at the expense of global processing. In the light of these studies, we propose that the mechanisms which can give rise to 'weak central coherence' effects may be perceptual. More specifically, we propose that perception operates to enhance the representation of individual perceptual features but that this does not impact adversely on representations that involve integration of features. This proposal was supported in the two experiments we report on configural and feature discrimination learning in high-functioning children with autism. We also examined processes of perception directly, in an auditory filtering task which measured the width of auditory filters in individuals with autism and found that the width of auditory filters in autism were abnormally broad. We consider the implications of these findings for perceptual theories of the mechanisms underpinning weak central coherence effects.},

  abstract = {Crowding, generally defined as the deleterious influence of nearby contours on visual discrimination, is ubiquitous in spatial vision. Crowding impairs the ability to recognize objects in clutter. It has been extensively studied over the last 80 years or so, and much of the renewed interest is the hope that studying crowding may lead to a better understanding of the processes involved in object recognition. Crowding also has important clinical implications for patients with macular degeneration, amblyopia and dyslexia. There is no shortage of theories for crowding\textemdash{}from low-level receptive field models to high-level attention. The current picture is that crowding represents an essential bottleneck for object perception, impairing object perception in peripheral, amblyopic and possibly developing vision. Crowding is neither masking nor surround suppression. We can localize crowding to the cortex, perhaps as early as V1; however, there is a growing consensus for a two-stage model of crowding in which the first stage involves the detection of simple features (perhaps in V1), and a second stage is required for the integration or interpretation of the features as an object beyond V1. There is evidence for top-down effects in crowding, but the role of attention in this process remains unclear. The strong effect of learning in shrinking the spatial extent of crowding places strong constraints on possible models for crowding and for object recognition. The goal of this review is to try to provide a broad, balanced and succinct review that organizes and summarizes the diverse and scattered studies of crowding, and also helps to explain it to the non-specialist. A full understanding of crowding may allow us to understand this bottleneck to object recognition and the rules that govern the integration of features into objects.},

We compared levels of GABAB receptor subunits GABAB receptor 1 (GABBR1) and GABAB receptor 2 (GABBR2) in cerebellum, Brodmann's area 9 (BA9), and BA40 of subjects with autism and matched controls. Levels of GABBR1 were significantly decreased in BA9, BA40, and cerebellum, while GABBR2 was significantly reduced in the cerebellum. The presence of seizure disorder did not have a significant impact on the observed reductions in GABAB receptor subunit expression. Decreases in GABAB receptor subunits may help explain the presence of seizures that are often comorbid with autism, as well as cognitive difficulties prevalent in autism.},

We confirmed that a stimulus of orientation orthogonal to a cell's long axis significantly reduces the cell's discharge rate. Further experiments revealed the following. (i) The inhibition was typically stronger for simple than for complex cells. (ii) It is very broadly tuned for orientation, all orientations outside the cell's tuning band having a comparable inhibitory effect. (iii) Similarly, it is broadly tuned for spatial frequency. These last two results suggest that the inhibition arises not from a single cell but from a pool of cells. (iv) The pattern of the discharge of the inhibition in response to stimulation by phase-reversed sinusoidal gratings is consistent with the notion that the inhibition arises from complex cells. A second series of recordings of stimulation by visual noise patterns demonstrated how `cross-orientation inhibition' prevents simple cells from responding to two-dimensional visual noise while allowing them to respond to comparable one-dimensional noise patterns. We suggest that this mechanism may serve to render simple cells selectively sensitive to one-dimensional stimuli, such as the contours or borders of visual objects.},

  abstract = {Gamma band oscillations arise in neuronal networks of interconnected GABAergic interneurons and excitatory pyramidal cells. A previous study found a correlation between visual gamma peak frequency, as measured with magnetoencephalography, and resting GABA levels, as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in 12 healthy volunteers. If true, this would allow studies in clinical populations testing modulation of this relationship, but this finding has not been replicated. We addressed this important question by measuring gamma oscillations and GABA, as well as glutamate, in 50 healthy volunteers. Visual gamma activity was evoked using an established gratings paradigm, and we applied a beamformer spatial filtering technique to extract source-reconstructed gamma peak frequency and amplitude from the occipital lobe. We determined gamma peak frequency and amplitude from the location with maximal activation and from the location of the MRS voxel to assess the relationship of GABA with gamma. Gamma peak frequency was estimated from the highest value of the raw spectra and by a Gaussian fit to the spectra. MRS data were acquired from occipital cortex. We did not replicate the previously found correlation between gamma peak frequency and GABA concentration. Calculation of a Bayes factor provided strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. We also did not find a correlation between gamma activity and glutamate or between gamma and the ratio of GABA/glutamate. Our results suggest that cortical gamma oscillations do not have a consistent, demonstrable relationship to excitatory/inhibitory network activity as proxied by MRS measurements of GABA and glutamate.},

The unseen stimulus is physically present but is not perceived because the sensory signals it elicits are suppressed. The neural site of this binocular rivalry suppression is a source of continuing controversy. We psychophysically tested human subjects, using test probes designed to selectively activate the visual system at a variety of processing stages. The results, which apply to both form and motion judgements, show that the sensitivity loss during suppression increases as the subject's task becomes more sophisticated. We conclude that binocular rivalry suppression is present at a number of stages along two visual cortical pathways, and that suppression deepens as the visual signal progresses along these pathways.},

Risk taking has a fourfold pattern varying as a function of probability and valence leading to the non-linearity of probability weighting with overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of large probabilities. Here we assess these influences on risk taking in patients with pathological behaviours towards drug and food rewards and examine structural neural correlates of non-linearity of probability weighting in healthy volunteers. In the anticipation of rewards, subjects with binge eating disorder show greater risk taking, similar to substance use disorders. Methamphetamine dependent subjects had greater non-linearity of probability weighting along with impaired subjective discrimination of probability and reward magnitude. Ex-smokers also had lower risk taking to rewards compared to non-smokers. In the anticipation of losses, obesity without binge eating had a similar pattern to other substance use disorders. Obese subjects with binge eating also have impaired discrimination of subjective value similar to that of the methamphetamine dependent subjects. Non-linearity of probability weighting was associated with lower grey matter volume in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in healthy volunteers. Our findings support a distinct subtype of binge eating disorder in obesity with similarities with substance use disorders to risk taking in the reward domain. The results dovetail with the current approach of defining mechanistically based dimensional approaches rather than categorical approaches to psychiatric disorders. The relationship to risk probability and valence may underlie the propensity towards pathological behaviours towards different types of rewards.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of the putative ``spatial filter'' and ``local sign'' mechanisms in determining line vernier thresholds for a range of target separations, using stimulus contrast or visibility as a tool. In Expt 1, the effects of varying target contrast and exposure duration on vernier thresholds for lines separated by 90 min arc, where the reference line was fixated, were measured. Contrast thresholds for the nonfixated test Une were also measured, so that the role of its visibility in limiting vernier thresholds could be assessed. Vernier thresholds decreased almost proportionally with increasing contrast only until the visibility of the test line reached about 3 times the contrast detection threshold, regardless of exposure duration. At higher visibility levels, vernier thresholds were virtually independent of target contrast. In Expt 2, the effects of varying target contrast on vernier thresholds for a range of target separations (2\textendash{}90 min arc) were measured using a 250 msec exposure duration. Vernier thresholds for abutting lines and for those separated by 2 min arc, decreased with target contrast until about 30 times the test line's contrast detection threshold. However for lines separated by 4 min arc or more, they were only weakly dependent on target contrast at much lower visibility levels. We propose that for very close separations vernier thresholds are limited by the contrast response properties of spatial filters. For separations of 4 min arc or more, thresholds appear to be limited by the positional uncertainty of the test line, which increases with eccentricity.},

We have recently proposed a general model to account for these atypicalities in Bayesian terms, suggesting that autistic individuals underuse predictive information or priors. We tested this idea by measuring adaptation to numerosity stimuli in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After exposure to large numbers of items, stimuli with fewer items appear to be less numerous (and vice versa). We found that children with ASD adapted much less to numerosity than typically developing children, although their precision for numerosity discrimination was similar to that of the typical group. This result reinforces recent findings showing reduced adaptation to facial identity in ASD and goes on to show that reduced adaptation is not unique to faces (social stimuli with special significance in autism), but occurs more generally, for both parietal and temporal functions, probably reflecting inefficiencies in the adaptive interpretation of sensory signals. These results provide strong support for the Bayesian theories of autism.},

  abstract = {Several recent reports in large, independent samples have demonstrated the influence of motion artifact on resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfc-MRI). Standard rsfc-MRI preprocessing typically includes regression of confounding signals and band-pass filtering. However, substantial heterogeneity exists in how these techniques are implemented across studies, and no prior study has examined the effect of differing approaches for the control of motion-induced artifacts. To better understand how in-scanner head motion affects rsfc-MRI data, we describe the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of motion artifacts in a sample of 348 adolescents. Analyses utilize a novel approach for describing head motion on a voxelwise basis. Next, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of a range of confound regression and filtering techniques for the control of motion-induced artifacts. Results reveal that the effectiveness of preprocessing procedures on the control of motion is heterogeneous, and that improved preprocessing provides a substantial benefit beyond typical procedures. These results demonstrate that the effect of motion on rsfc-MRI can be substantially attenuated through improved preprocessing procedures, but not completely removed.},

  abstract = {Importance: Physical activity (PA) may have a positive effect on depressed mood. However, whether it can act as a protective factor against developing depressive symptoms in adolescence is largely unknown.
Objective: To investigate the association between objectively measured PA and depressive symptoms during 3 years of adolescence.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed a longitudinal study between November 1, 2005, and January 31, 2010, of a community-based sample from Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, United Kingdom, that included 736 participants (mean [SD] age, 14.5 years [6 months]). The follow-up period was approximately 3 years after baseline (the ROOTS study). Linear regression models were fitted using physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as the predictors and depressive symptoms as the outcome variable. Binomial logistic regression models were also fitted using PAEE and MVPA as the predictors and clinical depression as the outcome measure.
Exposures: Exercise.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Individually calibrated heart rate and movement sensing were used to measure PA at baseline only. Physical activity summary measures included total PAEE and time spent in MVPA. These measures were divided into weekend and weekday activity. All participants also completed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, a self-report measure of current depressive symptoms, and took part in a Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version interview at baseline and 3 years later.
Results: Depressive symptoms at 3-year follow-up were not significantly predicted by any of the 4 PA measures at baseline: weekend MVPA (unstandardized $\beta$\,=\,0.02; 95\% CI, -0.15 to 0.20; P\,=\,.79), weekday MVPA ($\beta$\,=\,0.00; 95\% CI, -0.17 to 0.17; P\,=\,.99), weekend PAEE ($\beta$\,=\,0.03; 95\% CI, -0.14 to 0.20; P\,=\,.75), and weekday PAEE ($\beta$\,=\,-0.03; 95\% CI, -0.20 to 0.14; P\,=\,.71). This was also true for major depressive disorder diagnoses at follow-up: weekend MVPA (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95\% CI, 0.76-2.48; P\,=\,.30), weekday MVPA (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 0.74-2.37; P\,=\,.34), weekend PAEE (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.67-2.10; P\,=\,.56), and weekday PAEE (OR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.52-1.63; P\,=\,.78).
Conclusions and Relevance: No longitudinal association between objectively measured PA and the development of depressive symptoms was observed in this large population-based sample. These results do not support the hypothesis that PA protects against developing depressive symptoms in adolescence.},

  abstract = {Particularly promising studies on visual awareness exploit a generally used perceptual bistability phenomenon, ``binocular rivalry''\textemdash{}in which the two eyes' images alternately dominate\textemdash{}because it can dissociate the visual input from the perceptual output. To successfully study awareness, it is crucial to know the extent to which eye movements alter the input. Although there is convincing evidence that perceptual alternations can occur without eye movements, the literature on their exact role is mixed. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that eye movements, first, correlate positively with perceptual alternations in binocular rivalry, and second, often accompany covert attention shifts (that were previously thought to be purely mental). Here, we asked whether eye movements cause perceptual alternations, and if so, whether it is either the execution of the eye movement or the resulting retinal image change that causes the alternation. Subjects viewed repetitive line patterns, enabling a distinction of saccades that did produce foveal image changes from those that did not. Subjects reported binocular rivalry alternations. We found that, although a saccade is not essential to initiate percept changes, the foveal image change resulting from a (micro)saccade is a deciding factor for percept dominance. We conclude that the foveal image must change to have a saccade cause a change in awareness. This sheds new light on the interaction between spatial attention shifts and perceptual alternations.},

Here, we probe the neural basis of these deficits by using functional MRI (fMRI) and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) model to capture the centre-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2 and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal perception on a range of visual tasks, which has been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation/inhibition. However associated differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons have yet to be reported in vivo. We used fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to demonstrate that the fine-grained functional architecture of visual cortex in people with SZ differs from unaffected controls. SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, largely due to reduced inhibitory surrounds. An imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition could drive such a change in the centre-surround pRF configuration, and ultimately explain the range of visual deficits experienced in SZ.},

  abstract = {It has been fifty years since Levelt's monograph On Binocular Rivalry (1965) was published, but its four propositions that describe the relation between stimulus strength and the phenomenology of binocular rivalry remain a benchmark for theorists and experimentalists even today. In this review, we will revisit the original conception of the four propositions and the scientific landscape in which this happened. We will also provide a brief update concerning distributions of dominance durations, another aspect of Levelt's monograph that has maintained a prominent presence in the field. In a critical evaluation of Levelt's propositions against current knowledge of binocular rivalry we will then demonstrate that the original propositions are not completely compatible with what is known today, but that they can, in a straightforward way, be modified to encapsulate the progress that has been made over the past fifty years. The resulting modified, propositions are shown to apply to a broad range of bistable perceptual phenomena, not just binocular rivalry, and they allow important inferences about the underlying neural systems. We argue that these inferences reflect canonical neural properties that play a role in visual perception in general, and we discuss ways in which future research can build on the work reviewed here to attain a better understanding of these properties.},

  abstract = {During reach planning, we integrate multiple senses to estimate the location of the hand and the target, which is used to generate a movement. Visual and proprioceptive information are combined to determine the location of the hand. The goal of this study was to investigate whether multi-sensory integration is affected by extraretinal signals, such as head roll. It is believed that a coordinate matching transformation is required before vision and proprioception can be combined because proprioceptive and visual sensory reference frames do not generally align. This transformation utilizes extraretinal signals about current head roll position, i.e., to rotate proprioceptive signals into visual coordinates. Since head roll is an estimated sensory signal with noise, this head roll dependency of the reference frame transformation should introduce additional noise to the transformed signal, reducing its reliability and thus its weight in the multi-sensory integration. To investigate the role of noisy reference frame transformations on multi-sensory weighting, we developed a novel probabilistic (Bayesian) multi-sensory integration model (based on Sober and Sabes, ) that included explicit (noisy) reference frame transformations. We then performed a reaching experiment to test the model's predictions. To test for head roll dependent multi-sensory integration, we introduced conflicts between viewed and actual hand position and measured reach errors. Reach analysis revealed that eccentric head roll orientations led to an increase of movement variability, consistent with our model. We further found that the weighting of vision and proprioception depended on head roll, which we interpret as being a result of signal dependant noise. Thus, the brain has online knowledge of the statistics of its internal sensory representations. In summary, we show that sensory reliability is used in a context-dependent way to adjust multi-sensory integration weights for reaching.},

In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study we manipulated viewers' perspective to assess the part played by selective attention. Participants were cued to attend either to spatial properties of the movements or to the kind of social behavior it could represent. Activations that occurred to the initial cue, while observing the animations themselves and while responding to a postpresentation probe, were analyzed separately. Results showed that activity in the social brain network was strongly influenced by selective attention, and that remarkably similar activations were seen during film viewing and in response to probe questions. Our use of stimuli supporting rich and diverse social narratives likely enhanced the influence of top-down processes on neural activity in the social brain.},

  abstract = {In binocular rivalry, a subject views two incongruent stimuli through each eye but consciously perceives only one stimulus at a time, with a switch in perceptual dominance every few seconds. To investigate the continuous alternations in perceptual dominance across eyes objectively, thirteen subjects were recorded with 64-channel electroencephalograph while experiencing binocular rivalry. A blue vertical grating flickering at one frequency was presented to one eye and a blue horizontal grating flickering at a different frequency was presented to the other eye. Steady state evoked potential (SSVEP) at the two frequencies were used as tags for the two stimuli. SSVEP-based binocular rivalry has potential advantage of registering the alternation in physiological dominance of the two eyes. This paper presents a method of lead selection to improve the applicability of SSVEP-based binocular rivalry. Optimal lead is selected by comparing signal strength at two stimulus frequencies during rivalry dominance and rivalry suppression. The method with one optimal lead correlates better with the subjects' report of perceptual dominance.},

Here we hypothesized that sensory processing of information in the visual periphery would be impaired in schizophrenia patients and, as a result, crowding \textendash{} the breakdown in target recognition that occurs in cluttered visual environments \textendash{} would be stronger. Therefore, we assessed visual crowding in the peripheral vision of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Subjects were asked to identify a target letter that was surrounded by distracter letters of similar appearance. Targets and distracters were displayed at 8$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ of visual angle from the fixation point (eccentricity), and target-distracter spacing was 2$^\circ$, 3$^\circ$, 4$^\circ$, 5$^\circ$, 6$^\circ$, 7$^\circ$ or 8$^\circ$ of visual angle. Eccentricity and target-distracter spacing were randomly varied. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of correctly identified targets. Critical spacing was defined as the spacing at which target identification accuracy began to deteriorate, and was assessed at viewing eccentricities of 8$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$. Schizophrenia patients were less accurate and showed a larger critical spacing than healthy individuals. These results indicate that crowding is stronger and sensory processing of information in the visual periphery is impaired in schizophrenia. This is in line with previous reports of preferential magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia. Thus, deficits in peripheral vision may account for perceptual alterations and contribute to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

The gratings were modulated either in pure luminance contrast (and uniform colour), or pure chromatic contrast (red-green equiluminant gratings). In subjects of the same age groups, visual evoked potentials (VEP) were recorded in response to gratings with either pure luminance contrast or pure colour contrast sinusoidally reversed in contrast at various temporal frequencies. It was shown that psychophysical contrast sensitivity for equiluminant patterns deteriorates significantly with age, and VEP latency increases. However, these effects of ageing on the responses to patterns of pure colour contrast are substantially the same as those observed in the same subjects for stimuli with pure luminance contrast. The results suggest that ageing causes a small and unspecific decline of the response of the visual system to luminance and colour contrast. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Adults with autism exhibit inhibitory deficits that are often manifested in behavioral modifications, such as repetitive behaviors, and/or sensory hyper-responsiveness. If such behaviors are the result of a generalized deficiency in inhibitory neurotransmission, then it stands to reason that deficits involving localized cortical\textendash{}cortical interactions\textemdash{}such as in sensory discrimination tasks\textemdash{}could be detected and quantified. This study exemplifies a newly developed method for quantifying sensory testing metrics. Our novel sensory discrimination tests may provide (a) an effective means for biobehavioral assessment of deficits specific to autism and (b) an efficient and sensitive measure of change following treatment. The sensory discriminative capacity of ten subjects with autism and ten controls was compared both before and after short duration adapting stimuli. Specifically, vibrotactile amplitude discriminative capacity was obtained both in the presence and absence of 1 sec adapting stimuli that were delivered 1 sec prior to the comparison stimuli. Although adaptation had a pronounced effect on the amplitude discriminative capacity of the control subjects, little or no impact was observed on the sensory discriminative capacity of the subjects with autism. This lack of impact of the adapting stimuli on the responses of the subjects with autism was interpreted to be consistent with the reduced GABAergic-mediated inhibition described in previous reports. One significant aspect of this study is that the methods could prove to be a useful and efficient way to detect specific neural deficits and monitor the efficacy of pharmacological or behavioral treatments in autism.},

  title = {Intact Priors for Gaze Direction in Autism Spectrum Conditions},
  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are characterized by a range of perceptual
atypicalities, including abnormalities in gaze processing. Pellicano
and Burr (2012) recently proposed that perceptual atypicalities might be a
consequence of attenuated priors in ASC (i.e. reduced infl uence of prior
knowledge on the perception of sensory information). Evidence from neurotypical
populations indicates that under conditions of uncertainty (created
by adding noise to the eyes of face stimuli), gaze is more likely to be
perceived as direct (Mareschal et al., 2013), suggesting that humans have a
prior expectation that other people's gaze is directed toward them. Here we
adopted the same paradigm to address two questions: 1) Is the infl uence of
priors on gaze perception reduced as a function of autistic traits within a
neurotypical population (Experiment 1)? 2) Do individuals with diagnosis
of ASC show evidence for reduced infl uence of gaze priors (Experiment 2)?

noise contrast required for each participant to perform a left/right gaze discrimination
at 80\% correct. Participants were then required to judge the relative
gaze directions of two faces when noise was added to the eyes of one
face only. In Experiment 1, participants showed a signifi cant bias towards
perceiving uncertain gaze as direct, however this bias was not related to
increasing autistic traits. In Experiment 2, individuals with ASC showed a
robust direct gaze prior comparable to that of IQ matched controls. Given
that noise-thresholds did not differ across groups, this fi nding is unlikely
to refl ect a combination of attenuated priors and increased sensory noise
in ASC. These results pose a challenge to the hypoprior Bayesian model of
ASC and suggest that if ASC is characterized by atypicalities in the use of
prior information this is not refl ected in their performance on a gaze task.},

  abstract = {Do we identify an object as a whole or by its parts? This simple question has been surprisingly hard to answer. It has been suggested that faces are recognized as wholes and words are recognized by parts. Here we answer the question by applying a test for crowding. In crowding, a target is harder to identify in the presence of nearby flankers. Previous work has described crowding between objects. We show that crowding also occurs between the parts of an object. Such internal crowding severely impairs perception, identification, and fMRI face-area activation. We apply a diagnostic test for crowding to a word and a face, and we find that the critical spacing of the parts required for recognition is proportional to distance from fixation and independent of size and kind. The critical spacing defines an isolation field around the target. Some objects can be recognized only when each part is isolated from the rest of the object by the critical spacing. In that case, recognition is by parts. Recognition is holistic if the observer can recognize the object even when the whole object fits within a critical spacing. Such an object has only one part. Multiple parts within an isolation field will crowd each other and spoil recognition. To assess the robustness of the crowding test, we manipulated familiarity through inversion and the face- and word-superiority effects. We find that threshold contrast for word and face identification is the product of two factors: familiarity and crowding. Familiarity increases sensitivity by a factor of \texttimes{}1.5, independent of eccentricity, while crowding attenuates sensitivity more and more as eccentricity increases. Our findings show that observers process words and faces in much the same way: The effects of familiarity and crowding do not distinguish between them. Words and faces are both recognized by parts, and their parts \textemdash{} letters and facial features \textemdash{} are recognized holistically. We propose that internal crowding be taken as the signature of recognition by parts.},

  abstract = {Summary 
Object recognition in the peripheral visual field is limited by crowding: the disruptive influence of nearby clutter [1, 2]. Despite its severity, little is known about the cortical locus of crowding. Here, we examined the neural correlates of crowding by combining event-related fMRI adaptation with a change-detection paradigm [3]. Crowding can change the appearance of objects, such that items become perceptually matched to surrounding objects; we used this change in appearance as a signature of crowding and measured brain activity that correlated with the crowded percept. Observers adapted to a peripheral patch of noise surrounded by four Gabor flankers. When crowded, the noise appears oriented and perceptually indistinguishable from the flankers. Consequently, substitution of the noise for a Gabor identical to the flankers (``change-same'') is rarely detected, whereas substitution for an orthogonal Gabor (``change-different'') is rarely missed. We predicted that brain areas representing the crowded percept would show repetition suppression in change-same trials but release from adaptation in change-different trials. This predicted pattern was observed throughout cortical visual areas V1\textendash{}V4, increasing in strength from early to late visual areas. These results depict crowding as a multistage process, involving even the earliest cortical visual areas, with perceptual consequences that are increasingly influenced by later visual areas.},

  doi = {10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0737},
  abstract = {Importance~
More than half of youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have sensory overresponsivity (SOR), an extreme negative reaction to sensory stimuli. However, little is known about the neurobiological basis of SOR, and there are few effective treatments. Understanding whether SOR is due to an initial heightened sensory response or to deficits in regulating emotional reactions to stimuli has important implications for intervention.Objective
To determine differences in brain responses, habituation, and connectivity during exposure to mildly aversive sensory stimuli in youth with ASDs and SOR compared with youth with ASDs without SOR and compared with typically developing control subjects.Design, Setting, and Participants
Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine brain responses and habituation to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 19 high-functioning youths with ASDs and 19 age- and IQ-matched, typically developing youths (age range, 9-17 years). Brain activity was related to parents' ratings of children's SOR symptoms. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was compared between ASDs subgroups with and without SOR and typically developing controls without SOR. The study dates were March 2012 through February 2014.Main Outcomes and Measures
Relative increases in blood oxygen level\textendash{}dependent signal response across the whole brain and within the amygdala during exposure to sensory stimuli compared with fixation, as well as correlation between blood oxygen level\textendash{}dependent signal change in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.Results
The mean age in both groups was 14 years and the majority in both groups (16 of 19 each) were male. Compared with neurotypical control participants, participants with ASDs displayed stronger activation in primary sensory cortices and the amygdala (P\,$<$\,.05, corrected). This activity was positively correlated with SOR symptoms after controlling for anxiety. The ASDs with SOR subgroup had decreased neural habituation to stimuli in sensory cortices and the amygdala compared with groups without SOR. Youth with ASDs without SOR showed a pattern of amygdala downregulation, with negative connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (thresholded at z\,$>$\,1.70, P\,$<$\,.05).Conclusions and Relevance
Results demonstrate that youth with ASDs and SOR show sensorilimbic hyperresponsivity to mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli, particularly to multiple modalities presented simultaneously, and show that this hyperresponsivity is due to failure to habituate. In addition, findings suggest that a subset of youth with ASDs can regulate their responses through prefrontal downregulation of amygdala activity. Implications for intervention include minimizing exposure to multiple sensory modalities and building coping strategies for regulating emotional response to stimuli.},

Two conditions were used, in an attempt to explore group differences; standard two-dimensional black and white line drawings, and the same figures augmented with raised coloured lines. The subjects with autism were less likely to succumb to the two-dimensional illusions than were the other groups, and were less aided by the three-dimensional 'disembedded' condition.

Early visual areas showed mainly stimulus-driven retinotopy; parietal and frontal areas were driven primarily by attention; and lateral temporal regions could be driven by both. We found clear spatial specificity of attentional modulation not just in early visual areas but also in classical attentional control areas in parietal and frontal cortex. Indeed, strong spatiotopic activity in these areas could be evoked by directed attention alone. Conversely, motion-sensitive temporal regions, while exhibiting attentional modulation, also responded significantly when attention was directed away from the retinotopic stimuli.},

Contrary to prevailing theories of autism, performance was not associated with perceptual-discrimination thresholds for the same stimuli, but was associated with inspection-time threshold--a measure of speed of perceptual processing. Enhanced visual search in autism may, therefore, at least partially be explained by faster speed of processing.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with performance decrements across multiple cognitive domains. The neural noise hypothesis, a dominant view of the basis of this decline, posits that aging is accompanied by an increase in spontaneous, noisy baseline neural activity. Here we analyze data from two different groups of human subjects: intracranial electrocorticography from 15 participants over a 38 year age range (15\textendash{}53 years) and scalp EEG data from healthy younger (20\textendash{}30 years) and older (60\textendash{}70 years) adults to test the neural noise hypothesis from a 1/f noise perspective. Many natural phenomena, including electrophysiology, are characterized by 1/f noise. The defining characteristic of 1/f is that the power of the signal frequency content decreases rapidly as a function of the frequency (f) itself. The slope of this decay, the noise exponent ($\chi$), is often $<$-1 for electrophysiological data and has been shown to approach white noise (defined as $\chi$ = 0) with increasing task difficulty. We observed, in both electrophysiological datasets, that aging is associated with a flatter (more noisy) 1/f power spectral density, even at rest, and that visual cortical 1/f noise statistically mediates age-related impairments in visual working memory. These results provide electrophysiological support for the neural noise hypothesis of aging.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the neurobiological origins of age-related cognitive decline is of critical scientific, medical, and public health importance, especially considering the rapid aging of the world's population. We find, in two separate human studies, that 1/f electrophysiological noise increases with aging. In addition, we observe that this age-related 1/f noise statistically mediates age-related working memory decline. These results significantly add to this understanding and contextualize a long-standing problem in cognition by encapsulating age-related cognitive decline within a neurocomputational model of 1/f noise-induced deficits in neural communication.},

This work presents a method based on the time-frequency analysis of the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) that continuously registers the alternation in physiological dominance of the two eyes. Two images flickered at different frequencies as the visual stimulator to left and right eyes respectively so that the response can be recovered from the EEG by time-frequency analysis. The physiological dominance of each eye as evidenced by the SSVEP record correlates well with the subjects' report of perceptual dominance. This electrophysiological method appears to be suitable for measuring rivalry in non-verbal human or animals.},

Here we show that even at conventional resolutions it is possible to use fMRI to obtain a direct measure of orientation-selective processing in V1. We found that many parts of V1 show subtle but reproducible biases to oriented stimuli, and that we could accumulate this information across the whole of V1 using multivariate pattern recognition. Using this information, we could then successfully predict which one of two oriented stimuli a participant was viewing, even when masking rendered that stimulus invisible. Our findings show that conventional fMRI can be used to reveal feature-selective processing in human cortex, even for invisible stimuli.},

The goal of this review is to provide a broad-based synthesis of the most recent findings in this area, to define what crowding is and is not, and to set the stage for future work that will extend our understanding of crowding well beyond low-level vision. Here we define six diagnostic criteria for what counts as crowding, and further describe factors that both escape and break crowding. All of these lead to the conclusion that crowding occurs at multiple stages in the visual hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Our ability to recognize objects in peripheral vision is impaired when other objects are nearby (Bouma, 1970). This phenomenon, known as crowding, is often linked to interactions in early visual processing that depend primarily on the retinal position of visual stimuli (Pelli, 2008; Pelli and Tillman, 2008). Here we tested a new account that suggests crowding is influenced by spatial information derived from an extraretinal signal involved in eye movement preparation. We had human observers execute eye movements to crowded targets and measured their ability to identify those targets just before the eyes began to move. Beginning $\sim$50 ms before a saccade toward a crowded object, we found that not only was there a dramatic reduction in the magnitude of crowding, but the spatial area within which crowding occurred was almost halved. These changes in crowding occurred despite no change in the retinal position of target or flanking stimuli. Contrary to the notion that crowding depends on retinal signals alone, our findings reveal an important role for eye movement signals. Eye movement preparation effectively enhances object discrimination in peripheral vision at the goal of the intended saccade. These presaccadic changes may enable enhanced recognition of visual objects in the periphery during active search of visually cluttered environments.},

  abstract = {Crowding is a form of lateral interaction in which flanking items interfere with the detection or discrimination of a target stimulus. It is believed that crowding is a property of peripheral vision only and that no crowding occurs at fixation. If these two claims are true, then there must be a change in the nature of crowding interactions across the visual field. In three different tasks, we determined target size and flanker separation at threshold for eccentricities of 0 to 16$^\circ$ in the lower visual field for 7 relative separations (1.25 to 8 times target size). In all three tasks, the magnitude of crowding increases with eccentricity; there was no crowding at fixation and extreme crowding at 16$^\circ$. Using a novel double-scaling procedure, we show that the non-foveal data in all three tasks can be characterized as shifted versions of the same psychometric function such that different sections of the function characterize data at each eccentricity. This pattern of results can be understood in terms of size-dependent responses to the target and distance-dependent interference from the flankers. The data suggest that the distance-dependent interference increases with eccentricity.},

  abstract = {The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color, are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30\textendash{}80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. If neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.},

Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies have been published on various metabolite levels in autism, including glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, few 1H-MRS studies have yet been conducted the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.

Seventeen individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) participated in a single-voxel, point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) study conducted on a 3 T magnet. Data were also acquired on 14 unaffected siblings of children with autism, and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. GABA concentration was measured along with Creatine (Cr) in a single voxel aligned with the auditory cortex in the perisylvian region of the left hemisphere.

The ratio of GABA to Cr was significantly lower in the ASD group than the control subjects. Siblings also exhibited lower GABA/Cr ratios compared to controls. Cr concentration did not differ between groups. The volumes of gray matter, white matter and CSF did not differ between groups in the whole brain or within the spectroscopy voxel.

Reduced auditory GABA concentration in ASD is consistent with one previous MRS study of GABA concentration in the frontal lobe in autism, suggesting that multiple neocortical areas may be involved. Lower GABA levels are consistent with theories of ASD as a disorder involving impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and E/I imbalance. The reduction in unaffected siblings suggests that it may be a heritable biomarker, or endophenotype, of autism.},

Neurotypical and high-functioning adults with autism displayed very similar patterns and strengths of resting-state connectivity. We found only limited evidence in autism for abnormal resting-state connectivity at the regional level and no evidence for altered connectivity at the whole-brain level. Regional abnormalities in functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder were primarily in the frontal and temporal cortices. Within these regions, functional connectivity with other brain regions was almost exclusively lower in the autism group. Further examination showed that even small amounts of head motion during scanning have large effects on functional connectivity measures and must be controlled carefully. Consequently, we suggest caution in the interpretation of apparent positive findings until all possible confounding effects can be ruled out. Additionally, we do not rule out the possibility that abnormal connectivity in autism is evident at the microstructural synaptic level, which may not be reflected sensitively in hemodynamic changes measured with BOLD-fMRI.},

  abstract = {Atypical perceptual processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is well documented. In addition, growing evidence supports the hypothesis that an excitatory/inhibitory neurochemical imbalance might underlie ASD. Here we investigated putative behavioral consequences of the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the context of visual motion perception. As stimulus size increases, typical observers exhibit marked impairments in perceiving motion of high-contrast stimuli. This result, termed ``spatial suppression,'' is believed to reflect inhibitory motion-processing mechanisms. Motion processing is also affected by gain control, an inhibitory mechanism that underlies saturation of neural responses at high contrast. Motivated by these behavioral correlates of inhibitory function, we investigated motion perception in human children with ASD (n = 20) and typical development (n = 26). At high contrast, both groups exhibited similar impairments in motion perception with increasing stimulus size, revealing no apparent differences in spatial suppression. However, there was a substantial enhancement of motion perception in ASD: children with ASD exhibited a consistent twofold improvement in perceiving motion. Hypothesizing that this enhancement might indicate abnormal weakening of response gain control, we repeated our measurements at low contrast, where the effects of gain control should be negligible. At low contrast, we indeed found no group differences in motion discrimination thresholds. These low-contrast results, however, revealed weaker spatial suppression in ASD, suggesting the possibility that gain control abnormalities in ASD might have masked spatial suppression differences at high contrast. Overall, we report a pattern of motion perception abnormalities in ASD that includes substantial enhancements at high contrast and is consistent with an underlying excitatory/inhibitory imbalance.},

  abstract = {Objective 
The latest definitions of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) were specified in DSM-IV-TR in 2000. DSM-5 criteria are planned for 2013. Here, we estimated the prevalence of ASDs and autism according to DSM-IV-TR, clarified confusion concerning diagnostic criteria, and evaluated DSM-5 draft criteria for ASD posted by the American Psychiatry Association (APA) in February 2010. 
Method 
This was an epidemiological study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland, 4,422 (81\%) of them rated via the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire by parents and/or teachers, and 110 examined by using a structured interview, semi-structured observation, IQ measurement, school-day observation, and patient records. Diagnoses were assigned according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and DSM-5 draft criteria in children with a full-scale IQ (FSIQ) $\geq$50. Patient records were evaluated in children with an FSIQ \&lt;50 to discover diagnoses of ASDs. 
Results 
The prevalence of ASDs was 8.4 in 1,000 and that of autism 4.1 in 1,000 according to DSM-IV-TR. Of the subjects with ASDs and autism, 65\% and 61\% were high-functioning (FSIQ $\geq$70), respectively. The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified was not estimated because of inconsistency in DSM-IV-TR criteria. DSM-5 draft criteria were shown to be less sensitive in regard to identification of subjects with ASDs, particularly those with Asperger's syndrome and some high-functioning subjects with autism. 
Conclusions 
DSM-IV-TR helps with the definition of ASDs only up to a point. We suggest modifications to five details of DSM-5 draft criteria posted by the APA in February 2010. Completing revision of DSM criteria for ASDs is a challenging task.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes deficits in social cognition, communication, and executive function. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that ASD disrupts the structural and functional organization of brain networks and, presumably, how they generate information. Here, we relate deficits in an aspect of cognitive control to network-level disturbances in information processing. We recorded magnetoencephalography while children with ASD and typically developing controls performed a set-shifting task designed to test mental flexibility. We used multiscale entropy (MSE) to estimate the rate at which information was generated in a set of sources distributed across the brain. Multivariate partial least-squares analysis revealed 2 distributed networks, operating at fast and slow time scales, that respond completely differently to set shifting in ASD compared with control children, indicating disrupted temporal organization within these networks. Moreover, when typically developing children engaged these networks, they achieved faster reaction times. When children with ASD engaged these networks, there was no improvement in performance, suggesting that the networks were ineffective in children with ASD. Our data demonstrate that the coordination and temporal organization of large-scale neural assemblies during the performance of cognitive control tasks is disrupted in children with ASD, contributing to executive function deficits in this group.},

  abstract = {Object recognition is a central function of the visual system. As a first step, the features of an object are registered; these independently encoded features are then bound together to form a single representation. Here we investigate the locus of this ``feature integration'' by examining crowding, a striking breakdown of this process. Crowding, an inability to identify a peripheral target surrounded by flankers, results from ``excessive integration'' of target and flanker features. We presented a standard crowding display with a target C flanked by four flanker C's in the periphery. We then masked only the flankers (but not the target) with one of three kinds of masks\textemdash{}noise, metacontrast, and object substitution\textemdash{}each of which interferes at progressively higher levels of visual processing. With noise and metacontrast masks (low-level masking), the crowded target was recovered, whereas with object substitution masks (high-level masking), it was not. This places a clear upper bound on the locus of interference in crowding suggesting that crowding is not a low-level phenomenon. We conclude that feature integration, which underlies crowding, occurs prior to the locus of object substitution masking. Further, our results indicate that the integrity of the flankers, but not their identification, is crucial for crowding to occur.},

While these conditions have diverse etiologies, and poorly understood pathologies, emerging evidence suggests that they may all be linked to dysfunction in particular aspects of GABAergic inhibitory signalling in the brain. We review evidence from genetics, molecular neurobiology and systems neuroscience relating to the role of GABA in these conditions.

In one variation, the divided attention task, no information was given to children regarding the level at which a target would appear on any one trial. In the other, the selective attention task, children were instructed to attend to either the local or the global level. Typically developing children made most errors when the target appeared at the local level whereas children with autism made more errors when the target appeared at the global level in the divided attention task. Both groups of children were quicker to respond to the global target than the local target in the selective attention task. The presence of normal global processing in the children with autism in one task but not in the other is discussed in terms of a deficit in mechanisms that inhibit local information in the absence of overt priming or voluntary selective attention to local information.},

We conclude by discussing a number of extant questions. Firstly, we consider whether aberrant connectivity should be seen as part of the primary pathogenesis of autism, or whether disrupted connectivity in ASD emerges over time. Secondly, we consider how the patterns of disrupted connectivity found in ASD might relate to those being found in a range of other disorders.},

Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse. These results indicate that the vulnerability to stimulant addiction may depend on an impulsivity endophenotype. Implications of these findings for the etiology, development, and treatment of drug addiction are considered.},

The rate of comorbidity varies, depending upon the age and type of disorder, and currently the conservative estimate of comorbidity cases is 20-25\% of the whole spectrum. Major risk factors for seizure occurrence are mental retardation and additional neurological disorders, as well as some specific associated medical conditions. Autism with regression has been reported in one-third of children with previously normal or nearly normal development. In an unknown proportion of these subjects, epileptic disorders are concomitant, leading to so-called autistic epileptiform regression. Furthermore, epileptiform abnormalities without seizures are frequent in this population and their role in the development of the nuclear disturbances of autism is controversial. The therapeutic approaches to epilepsy in autism are conventional treatments, yet when seizures are not evident, there is still controversy. Anticonvulsant medications could also potentially interfere with mood and behavioral disturbances frequently observed in ASD. The current understanding of the association between epilepsy and autism is still limited, but from a clinical point of view this association should not be overlooked, and it should be routinely investigated.},

Top-down priming biases competition towards objects relevant to current behaviour. Recent single-unit studies have shown widespread suppression of ignored-object representations in extrastriat cortex, and patterns of spatial and nonspatial priming by task relevance. Human and monkey lesion studies have demonstrated the strong integration tendency of different spatial and nonspatial systems, also revealed in recent studies of normal behaviour. In many cases, no unitary brain system may be responsible for unitary cognitive events such as attention. Such events may emerge as distinct systems converge to work on common cognitive problems.},

Part 1 explains the approach to the study of vision, thus providing the philosophical theme for the chapters that follow. Part 2 on physiological mechanisms presents examples of comparative and physiological investigations. Part 3 on sensitivity and adaptation examines new research that bears directly upon the classical problems of visual psychophysics. Here, there is an initial concern with measurement, visual sensitivity, scaling, and adaptation. Part 4 discusses research on color vision while Part 5 on acuity, contrast, and movement considers some of the factors that contribute to these perceptions. Part 6 deals with applications of visual science to other disciplines. Specific examples are given that link visual research with ophthalmology, child development, and the investigation of cognitive variables such as meaning, activation, and so forth.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground
Biomedical treatment options for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are extremely limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions.
Objective
The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD.
Methods
28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-second train duration, 20-second intertrain interval) for 15 minutes (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain. Assessments were conducted before, after, and one month following treatment.
Results
Participants in the active condition showed a near significant reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms from pre-treatment to one month follow-up, and a significant reduction in social relating symptoms (relative to sham participants) for both post-treatment assessments. Those in the active condition also showed a reduction in self-oriented anxiety during difficult and emotional social situations from pre-treatment to one month follow-up. There were no changes for those in the sham condition.
Conclusion
Deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex yielded a reduction in social relating impairment and socially-related anxiety. Further research in this area should employ extended rTMS protocols that approximate those used in depression in an attempt to replicate and amplify the clinical response.},

This study examined whether this crowding phenomenon, and particularly its spatial extent, is affected by the allocation of spatial attention to the target location. We measured orientation identification of a rotated T with and without flankers. The distance between the target and the flankers and their eccentricity varied systematically. We manipulated attention via peripheral precues: in the cued condition, a dot indicated the target location prior to its onset. On the neutral condition, a central disk conveyed no information regarding the target location (Experiments 1\textendash{}2), and on the invalid condition (Experiment 3), an invalid cue attracted attention to a nontarget location. We found, across all experiments, at all eccentricities, a significant attentional enhancement of identification accuracy. Most importantly, we found a significant attentional reduction of the critical distance (i.e., the target\textendash{}flankers distance at which the flankers no longer interfere with target identification). These attentional effects were found regardless of the presence or absence of a backward mask and whether the attentional cue was informative or not. These findings suggest that attention reduces the spatial extent of crowding.},

This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to adults with autism.

Experiment 3 showed that increases in target-distractor similarity slowed the visual search performance of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group, suggesting that the adults with autism have a superior visual discrimination ability. Thus, these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism. Superior unique item detection in adults with autism, stemming from enhanced discrimination, is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general.},

In this study, contrast sensitivity for both luminance and texture-defined vertically-oriented sine-wave gratings were measured across a range of spatial frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4 \& 8 cpd) for autistics and non-autistic participants. Contrast sensitivity functions and peak frequency ratios were plotted and compared across groups. Results demonstrated that autistic participants were more sensitivity to luminance-defined, high spatial frequency gratings (8 cpd). A group difference in peak distribution was also observed as 35\% of autistic participants manifested peak sensitivity for luminance-defined gratings of 4 cpd, compared to only 7\% for the comparison group. These findings support that locally-biased perception in Autism Spectrum Disorder originates, at least in part, from differences in response properties of early spatial mechanisms favouring detailed spatial information processing.},

To understand perception, the signal codes and the stored knowledge or assumptions used for deriving perceptual hypotheses must be discovered. Systematic perceptual errors are important clues for appreciating signal channel limitations, and for discovering hypothesis-generating procedures. Although this distinction between 'physiological' and 'cognitive' aspects of perception may be logically clear, it is in practice surprisingly difficult to establish which are responsible even for clearly established phenomena such as the classical distortion illusions. Experimental results are presented, aimed at distinguishing between and discovering what happens when there is mismatch with the neural signal channel, and when neural signals are processed inappropriately for the current situation. This leads us to make some distinctions between perceptual and scientific hypotheses, which raise in a new form the problem: What are 'objects'?},

Recent research has begun to investigate sensory processing in relation to nonclinical variation in traits associated with the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We propose that existing accounts of autistic perception can be augmented by considering a role for individual differences in top\textendash{}down expectations for the precision of sensory input, related to the processing of state-dependent levels of uncertainty. We therefore examined ASD-like traits in relation to the rubber-hand illusion: an experimental paradigm that typically elicits crossmodal integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information in an unusual illusory context. Individuals with higher ASD-like traits showed reduced effects of the rubber-hand illusion on perceived arm position and reach-to-grasp movements, compared to individuals with lower ASD-like traits. These differences occurred despite both groups reporting the typical subjective experience of the illusion concerning visuotactile integration and ownership for the rubber hand. Together these results suggest that the integration of proprioceptive information with cues for arm position derived from the illusory context differs between individuals partly in relation to traits associated with ASD. We suggest that the observed differences in sensory integration can be best explained in terms of differing expectations regarding the precision of sensory estimates in contexts that suggest uncertainty.},

In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

  abstract = {These studies provide evidence for slowed spatial orienting of attention in autism. A group of well-defined adult autistic subjects and age-matched normal controls performed a traditional spatial cueing task in which attention-related response facilitation is indexed by speed of target detection. To address the concern that motor impairment may interfere with interpretation of response time measures in those with neurologic abnormality, we also used a new adaptation of the traditional task that depended on accuracy of response (target discrimination) rather than speed of response. This design allowed separation of time to process and respond to target information from the time to move and engage (orient) attention. Results from both tasks were strikingly similar. Normal subjects oriented attention very quickly, and showed maximal performance facilitation at a cued location within 100 ms. Autistic subjects oriented attention much more slowly and showed increasing benefits of a spatial cue with increasing cue-to-target delays. These results are consistent with previous reports that patients with autism, the majority of whom have developmental abnormalities of the cerebellum, as well as those with acquired damage to the cerebellum, are slow to shift attention between and within modalities. This paper also addresses the variability in behavioral findings in autism, and suggests that many of the apparently contradictory findings may actually reflect sampling differences in patterns of brain pathology.},

According to a popular theory first proposed in 1901, neurons encoding the two stimuli engage in reciprocal inhibition [3-8] so that those processing one stimulus inhibit those processing the other, yielding consciousness of one dominant stimulus at any moment and suppressing the other. Also according to the theory, neurons encoding the dominant stimulus adapt, weakening their activity and the inhibition they can exert, whereas neurons encoding the suppressed stimulus recover from adaptation until the balance of activity reverses, triggering an alternation in consciousness. Despite its popularity, this theory has one glaring inconsistency with data: during an episode of suppression, visual sensitivity to brief probe stimuli in the dominant eye should decrease over time and should increase in the suppressed eye, yet sensitivity appears to be constant [9, 10]. Using more appropriate probe stimuli (experiment 1) in conjunction with a new method (experiment 2), we found that sensitivities in dominance and suppression do show the predicted complementary changes.},

  abstract = {During natural vision, the entire visual field is stimulated by images rich in spatiotemporal structure. Although many visual system studies restrict stimuli to the classical receptive field (CRF), it is known that costimulation of the CRF and the surrounding nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) increases neuronal response sparseness. The cellular and network mechanisms underlying increased response sparseness remain largely unexplored. Here we show that combined CRF + nCRF stimulation increases the sparseness, reliability, and precision of spiking and membrane potential responses in classical regular spiking (RS(C)) pyramidal neurons of cat primary visual cortex. Conversely, fast-spiking interneurons exhibit increased activity and decreased selectivity during CRF + nCRF stimulation. The increased sparseness and reliability of RS(C) neuron spiking is associated with increased inhibitory barrages and narrower visually evoked synaptic potentials. Our experimental observations were replicated with a simple computational model, suggesting that network interactions among neuronal subtypes ultimately sharpen recurrent excitation, producing specific and reliable visual responses.},

  abstract = {In schizophrenia, aberrant brain activity has been reported both during stimulus processing and at rest. Evoked response amplitude is a function of both the number and synchronization of neurons firing in relation to a stimulus. It is at present unclear whether schizophrenia patients have normal synchronization of neural activity in relation to stimulus processing, and whether the amount and time course of synchronization is related to their evoked response amplitudes. EEG brain dynamics in response to visual steady-state stimulation were assessed in 12 schizophrenia and 12 healthy subjects at three stimulation durations (2, 4, and 6 s). Group differences in the visual evoked potential, the visual steady-state response, and the local coherence of the visual steady-state response were evaluated over time. Schizophrenia patients had smaller and delayed event-related potentials. Moreover, they had a slower buildup of steady-state amplitude following stimulation onset and a prolonged decrease after stimulation offset. Groups did not differ during mid-segments of steady-state stimulation. Increase in coherence to stimulation onset did not differ between-groups, but coherence decay of the visual steady-state response following stimulus offset was delayed in schizophrenia patients. The initial response to visual stimulation among schizophrenia subjects, therefore, may be reduced in amplitude due to weak signal strength, not poor coordination between distant cortical regions. The prolonged recovery function of schizophrenia patients' visual system may indicate abnormal nonlinearity in neural response. These findings have implications understanding the nature of evoked response differences between schizophrenia and normal groups especially in repetitive stimulus paradigms.},

  abstract = {Introduction Various experimental manipulations, usually involving drug administration, have been used to produce symptoms of psychosis in healthy volunteers. Different drugs produce both common and distinct symptoms. A challenge is to understand how apparently different manipulations can produce overlapping symptoms. We suggest that current Bayesian formulations of information processing in the brain provide a framework that maps onto neural circuitry and gives us a context within which we can relate the symptoms of psychosis to their underlying causes. This helps us to understand the similarities and differences across the common models of psychosis. Materials and methods The Bayesian approach emphasises processing of information in terms of both prior expectancies and current inputs. A mismatch between these leads us to update inferences about the world and to generate new predictions for the future. According to this model, what we experience shapes what we learn, and what we learn modifies how we experience things. Discussion This simple idea gives us a powerful and flexible way of understanding the symptoms of psychosis where perception, learning and inference are deranged. We examine the predictions of the cognitive model in light of what we understand about the neuropharmacology of psychotomimetic drugs and thereby attempt to account for the common and the distinctive effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, serotonergic hallucinogens, cannabinoids and dopamine agonists. Conclusion By acknowledging the importance of perception and perceptual aberration in mediating the positive symptoms of psychosis, the model also provides a useful setting in which to consider an under-researched model of psychosis\textemdash{}sensory deprivation.},

  abstract = {When sensory input allows for multiple, competing perceptual interpretations, observers' perception can fluctuate over time, which is called bistable perception. Imaging studies in humans have revealed transient responses in a right-lateralized network in the frontal-parietal cortex (rFPC) around the time of perceptual transitions between interpretations, potentially reflecting the neural initiation of transitions. We investigated the role of this activity in male human observers, with specific interest in its relation to the temporal structure of transitions, which can be either instantaneous or prolonged by periods during which observers experience a mix of both perceptual interpretations. Using both bistable apparent motion and binocular rivalry, we show that transition-related rFPC activity is larger for transitions that last longer, suggesting that rFPC remains active as long as a transition lasts. We also replicate earlier findings that rFPC activity during binocular rivalry transitions exceeds activity during yoked transitions that are simulated using video replay. However, we show that this established finding holds only when perceptual transitions are replayed as instantaneous events. When replay, instead, depicts transitions with the actual durations reported during rivalry, yoked transitions and genuine rivalry transitions elicit equal activity. Together, our results are consistent with the view that at least a component of rFPC activation during bistable perception reflects a response to perceptual transitions, both real and yoked, rather than their cause. This component of activity could reflect the change in sensory experience and task demand that occurs during transitions, which fits well with the known role of these areas in attention and decision making.},

  doi = {10.3389/fnhum.2011.00155},
  abstract = {Starting from early scientific explorations of binocular rivalry, researchers have wondered about the degree to which an observer can exert voluntary attentional control over rivalry dynamics. The answer to this question would not only reveal the extent to which we may determine our own conscious visual experience, but also advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying binocular rivalry. Classic studies, intriguingly, reached contradictory conclusions, ranging from an absence of attentional control, as advocated by Breese, to nearly complete control of rivalry dynamics, as reported by Helmholtz. Recent investigations have revisited this question, but the results have continued to echo the conflicting findings of earlier studies, seemingly precluding a comprehensive understanding of attentional effects on rivalry. Here, we review both classic and modern studies, and propose a unifying framework derived from the biased competition theory of attention. The key assumption of this theory is that the nature of stimulus conflict determines the limits of attentional modulation. For example, a condition in which unresolved stimulus conflict transpires through many levels of visual processing should be very susceptible to attentional control. When applied to binocular rivalry, this framework predicts strong attentional modulations under conditions of unresolved stimulus conflict (e.g., initial selection) and conditions where conflict is resolved at higher levels of visual processing (e.g., stimulus rivalry). Additionally, the efficacy of attentional control over rivalry can be increased by utilization of demanding, behaviorally relevant tasks, and likely through perceptual training paradigms. We show that this framework can help facilitate the understanding and synthesis of a diverse set of results on attentional control over rivalry, and we propose several directions for future research on this interesting topic.},

To fill this gap, 18 autistics and 18 typical participants completed a melodic decision task where global and local level information can be congruent or incongruent. While focusing either on the global (melody) or local level (group of notes) of hierarchical auditory stimuli, participants have to decide whether the focused level is rising or falling. Autistics showed intact global processing, a superior performance when processing local elements and a reduced global-to-local interference compared to typical participants. These results are the first to demonstrate that autistic processing of auditory hierarchical stimuli closely parallels processing of visual hierarchical stimuli. When analyzing complex auditory information, autistic participants present a local bias and a more autonomous local processing, but not to the detriment of global processing.},

While arriving at sceptical answers to these four questions, the essay nonetheless offers some ideas about how a more nuanced utilization of binocular rivalry may still provide fundamental insights about neural dynamics, and glimpses of at least some of the ingredients comprising neural correlates of consciousness, including those involved in perceptual decision-making.},

The chapter focuses on perceptually oriented behaviors that are characteristic of certain nonautistic persons that may be implicated in autistic symptomatology. Patterns of perceptual processing among persons with savant syndromes, blindness, visual agnosia, and frontotemporal dementia are examined as models of a vertical imbalance that may be a source of enhanced abilities in general, and among persons with autism in particular. Three strategies are highlighted that the authors consider to be helpful in better understanding aspects of cognitive enhancement among persons with autism: (1) neurological systems as loci of enhanced performance in cognition; (2) the relation between cognitive impairments and examples of enhanced performance; and (3) a developmental framework for speculating about possible origins of enhanced perceptual functioning.},

We performed a meta-analysis of PV expression in previously published ASD mouse models and analyzed two additional models, reflecting an embryonic chemical insult (prenatal valproate, VPA) or single-gene mutation identified in human patients (Neuroligin-3, NL-3 R451C). PV-cells were reduced in the neocortex across multiple ASD mouse models. In striking contrast to controls, both VPA and NL-3 mouse models exhibited an asymmetric PV-cell reduction across hemispheres in parietal and occipital cortices (but not the underlying area CA1).

Binocular rivalry and attention both involve selection of visual stimuli, but affect perception quite differently. During binocular rivalry, awareness alternates between two different stimuli presented to the two eyes. In contrast, attending to one of two different stimuli impairs discrimination of the ignored stimulus, but without causing it to disappear from consciousness. Here we show that despite this difference, attention and rivalry rely on shared object-based selection mechanisms. We cued attention to one of two superimposed transparent surfaces and then deleted the image of one surface from each eye, resulting in rivalry. Observers usually reported seeing only the cued surface. They were also less accurate in judging unpredictable changes in the features of the uncued surface. Our design ensured that selection of the cued surface could not have resulted from spatial, ocular or feature-based mechanisms. Rather, attention was drawn to one surface, and this caused the other surface to be perceptually suppressed during rivalry. These results raise the question of how object representations compete during these two forms of perceptual selection, even as the features of those objects change unpredictably over time.},

Modified rabies virus tracing was used to monitor the extent of pyramidal cell connectivity: Horizontal connectivity is greater in the visual cortex of KbDb KO mice. Basal dendrites of L2/3 pyramids, where many horizontal connections terminate, are more highly branched and have elevated spine density in the KO. Furthermore, the density of axonal boutons is elevated within L2/3 of mutant mice. These increases are accompanied by elevated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency, consistent with an increase in functional synapses. This functional and anatomical increase in intracortical connectivity is also associated with enhanced ocular dominance plasticity that persists into adulthood. Thus, these MHCI proteins regulate sculpting of local cortical circuits and in their absence, the excess connectivity can function as a substrate for cortical plasticity throughout life.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenic patients have bizarre experiences which reflect a disorder in the contents of consciousness. For example, patients hear voices talking about them or they are convinced that alien forces are controlling their actions. Their abnormal behaviour includes incoherence and lack of will. In this book an explanation of these baffling signs and symptoms is provided using the framework of cognitive neuropsychology. The cognitive abnormalities that underlie these signs and symptoms suggest impairment in a system which constructs and monitors representations of certain abstract (especially mental) events in consciousness. For example, schizophrenic patients can no longer construct representations of their intentions to act. Thus, if actions occur, these will be experienced as coming out of the blue and hence can seem alien. The patient who lacks awareness of his own intentions will stop acting spontaneously and hence will show a lack of will. The psychological processes that are abnormal in schizophrenia can be related to underlying brain systems using evidence from human and animal neuropsychology. Interactions between prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain, especially temporal cortex appear critical for constructing the contents of consciousness. It is these interactions that are likely to be impaired in schizophrenia.},

In the diencephalon the lowest self-stimulation thresholds and the highest response rates were in the areas traversed by the dopamine fiber bundles. In the midbrain, self-stimulation was restricted to the layer of dopamine containing cell bodies. Self-stimulation current thresholds and responses rates were proportional to the density of dopaminergic elements surrounding the electrode tip; the lowest thresholds and highest response rates were associated with the densest packing of dopaminergic neurons. However, not all portions of the dopamine cell groups supported self-stimulation. Self-stimulation was not obtained from the caudal poles of the A9 and A10 groups, nor from the A8 cell group.

These findings suggest that a certain population of dopaminergic neurons directly participates in what is probably a multiple-link circuitry subserving positive reinforcement.},

  abstract = {Summary
Neuroplasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that is maximal early in life, within the critical period [1\textendash{}3]. Resting GABAergic inhibition is necessary to trigger ocular dominance plasticity and to modulate the onset and offset of the critical period [4, 5]. GABAergic inhibition also plays a crucial role in neuroplasticity of adult animals: the balance between excitation and inhibition in the primary visual cortex (V1), measured at rest, modulates the susceptibility of ocular dominance to deprivation [6\textendash{}10]. In adult humans, short-term monocular deprivation strongly modifies ocular balance, unexpectedly boosting the deprived eye, reflecting homeostatic plasticity [11, 12]. There is no direct evidence, however, to support resting GABAergic inhibition in homeostatic plasticity induced by visual deprivation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GABAergic inhibition, measured at rest, is reduced by deprivation, as demonstrated by animal studies. GABA concentration in V1 of adult humans was measured using ultra-high-field 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and~after short-term monocular deprivation. After monocular deprivation, resting GABA concentration decreased in V1 but was unaltered in a control parietal area. Importantly, across participants, the decrease in GABA strongly correlated with the deprived eye perceptual boost measured by binocular rivalry. Furthermore, after deprivation, GABA concentration measured during monocular stimulation correlated with the deprived eye dominance. We suggest that reduction in resting GABAergic inhibition triggers homeostatic plasticity in adult human V1 after a brief period of abnormal visual experience. These results are potentially useful for developing new therapeutic strategies that could exploit the intrinsic residual plasticity of the adult human visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence indicates that neuronal surround modulation at cross-orientation (orthogonal to the preferred orientation of the classical receptive field) plays a key role in intermediate-level visual tasks, such as textural segregation and perceptual pop-out. What is missing is a psychophysical description of cross surround modulation at the spatial filter level in low-level vision. Moreover, neurophysiological evidence for how cross surround modulation is expressed at the neuronal level has been inconsistent. Here we report evidence for psychophysical facilitation of contrast detection by cross surround stimuli (orthogonal to the target orientation) that may provide insights into both the neurophysiology and psychophysics of cross surround modulation. We found that cross surround facilitation is a surround-contrast dependent effect mainly evident at low surround contrasts, and is narrowly tuned to spatial frequency and broadly tuned to orientation. To understand whether cross surround facilitation results from low-level processing of signal-to-noise enhancement or is due to uncertainty reduction at a higher-level decision stage, we (1) studied cross surround facilitation with an equivalent noise protocol, (2) estimated the changes in the slope of the psychometric function and the uncertainty parameter, M, and (3) measured cross surround effects at the dipper of the TvC function. The converging evidence suggests that cross surround facilitation of contrast detection is mainly a result of low-level signal-to-noise enhancement, and is little affected by uncertainty change.},

Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The ability to remember faces is critical for the development of social competence. From childhood to adulthood, we acquire a high level of expertise in the recognition of facial images, and neural processes become dedicated to sustaining competence. Many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have poor face recognition memory; changes in hairstyle or other non-facial features in an otherwise familiar person affect their recollection skills. The observation implies that they may not use the configuration of the inner face to achieve memory competence, but bolster performance in other ways. We aimed to test this hypothesis by comparing the performance of a group of high-functioning unmedicated adolescents with ASD and a matched control group on a ``surprise'' face recognition memory task. We compared their memory for unfamiliar faces with their memory for images of houses. To evaluate the role that is played by peripheral cues in assisting recognition memory, we cropped both sets of pictures, retaining only the most salient central features. ASD adolescents had poorer recognition memory for faces than typical controls, but their recognition memory for houses was unimpaired. Cropping images of faces did not disproportionately influence their recall accuracy, relative to controls. House recognition skills (cropped and uncropped) were similar in both groups. In the ASD group only, performance on both sets of task was closely correlated, implying that memory for faces and other complex pictorial stimuli is achieved by domain-general (non-dedicated) cognitive mechanisms. Adolescents with ASD apparently do not use domain-specialized processing of inner facial cues to support face recognition memory.

  abstract = {Enhanced perception of detail has long been regarded a hallmark of autism spectrum conditions (ASC), but its origins are unknown. Normal sensitivity on all fundamental perceptual measures\textemdash{}visual acuity, contrast discrimination, and flicker detection\textemdash{}is strongly established in the literature. If individuals with ASC do not have superior low-level vision, how is perception of detail enhanced? We argue that this apparent paradox can be resolved by considering visual attention, which is known to enhance basic visual sensitivity, resulting in greater acuity and lower contrast thresholds. Here, we demonstrate that the focus of attention and concomitant enhancement of perception are sharper in human individuals with ASC than in matched controls. Using a simple visual acuity task embedded in a standard cueing paradigm, we mapped the spatial and temporal gradients of attentional enhancement by varying the distance and onset time of visual targets relative to an exogenous cue, which obligatorily captures attention. Individuals with ASC demonstrated a greater fall-off in performance with distance from the cue than controls, indicating a sharper spatial gradient of attention. Further, this sharpness was highly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms in ASC, as well as autistic traits across both ASC and control groups. These findings establish the presence of a form of ``tunnel vision'' in ASC, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of the social and neurobiological aspects of autism.},

Both in abuse/addiction and in obesity, there is an enhanced value of one type of reinforcer (drugs and food, respectively) at the expense of other reinforcers, which is a consequence of conditioned learning and resetting of reward thresholds secondary to repeated stimulation by drugs (abuse/addiction) and by large quantities of palatable food (obesity) in vulnerable individuals (i.e. genetic factors). In this model, during exposure to the reinforcer or to conditioned cues, the expected reward (processed by memory circuits) overactivates the reward and motivation circuits while inhibiting the cognitive control circuit, resulting in an inability to inhibit the drive to consume the drug or food despite attempts to do so. These neuronal circuits, which are modulated by DA, interact with one another so that disruption in one circuit can be buffered by another, which highlights the need of multiprong approaches in the treatment of addiction and obesity.},

On one hand, neuroimaging studies show that long-range correlations are highly structured in spatiotemporal patterns, known as resting-state networks, on the other hand, neurophysiological reports show that short-range correlations between neighboring neurons are low, despite a large amount of shared presynaptic inputs. Different dynamical mechanisms of local decorrelation have been proposed, among which is feedback inhibition. Here, we investigated the effect of locally regulating the feedback inhibition on the global dynamics of a large-scale brain model, in which the long-range connections are given by diffusion imaging data of human subjects. We used simulations and analytical methods to show that locally constraining the feedback inhibition to compensate for the excess of long-range excitatory connectivity, to preserve the asynchronous state, crucially changes the characteristics of the emergent resting and evoked activity. First, it significantly improves the model's prediction of the empirical human functional connectivity. Second, relaxing this constraint leads to an unrealistic network evoked activity, with systematic coactivation of cortical areas which are components of the default-mode network, whereas regulation of feedback inhibition prevents this. Finally, information theoretic analysis shows that regulation of the local feedback inhibition increases both the entropy and the Fisher information of the network evoked responses. Hence, it enhances the information capacity and the discrimination accuracy of the global network. In conclusion, the local excitation\textendash{}inhibition ratio impacts the structure of the spontaneous activity and the information transmission at the large-scale brain level.},

  doi = {10.1167/13.6.12},
  abstract = {It is generally believed that percept alternations in binocular rivalry result from the interplay between mutual inhibition and slow adaptation of the competing percepts. This view is supported by growing evidence that dynamic changes in adaptation indeed support percept alternations in binocular rivalry. Empirical evidence for the involvement of mutual inhibition, however, is still scarce. To fill this gap, we presented human subjects with dichoptic random-dot motion stimuli and manipulated the angle between the monocular directions of motion from pure opponent horizontal motion to pure vertical motion in the same direction. We hypothesized that this decrease in motion\textendash{}direction disparity increases the cross-inhibition gain due to lateral inhibition between neurons in the brain that are coarsely tuned to adjacent directions of visual motion, which predicts the largest changes in dominance at the smallest instead of the largest motion\textendash{}direction disparities. We found that decreasing the angle between the two monocular directions of motion indeed systematically increased the predominance and mean dominance durations of the motion pattern presented to the ocular dominant eye (as identified by the hole-in-card test). Moreover, this effect was stronger if the contrast of the stimuli was lowered. Simulations showed that these features are indeed hallmark of weighted lateral inhibition between populations of directionally tuned motion-sensitive neurons. Our findings thus suggest dominance and suppression in binocular rivalry arises naturally from this fundamental principle in sensory processing. Interestingly, if the two monocular directions of motion differed $<$60$^\circ$, the percept alternations also included transitions to in-between (vertical) motion percepts. We speculate that this behavior might result from positive feedback arising from adapting disinhibitory circuits in the network.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Cerebral cortex has a very large number of testosterone receptors, which could be a basis for sex differences in sensory functions. For example, audition has clear sex differences, which are related to serum testosterone levels. Of all major sensory systems only vision has not been examined for sex differences, which is surprising because occipital lobe (primary visual projection area) may have the highest density of testosterone receptors in the cortex. We have examined a basic visual function: spatial and temporal pattern resolution and acuity.

METHODS

We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision. They were screened with a battery of standard tests that examined acuity, color vision, and stereopsis. We sampled the visual system's contrast-sensitivity function (CSF) across the entire spatio-temporal space: 6 spatial frequencies at each of 5 temporal rates. Stimuli were gratings with sinusoidal luminance profiles generated on a special-purpose computer screen; their contrast was also sinusoidally modulated in time. We measured threshold contrasts using a criterion-free (forced-choice), adaptive psychophysical method (QUEST algorithm). Also, each individual's acuity limit was estimated by fitting his or her data with a model and extrapolating to find the spatial frequency corresponding to 100\% contrast.

RESULTS

At a very low temporal rate, the spatial CSF was the canonical inverted-U; but for higher temporal rates, the maxima of the spatial CSFs shifted: Observers lost sensitivity at high spatial frequencies and gained sensitivity at low frequencies; also, all the maxima of the CSFs shifted by about the same amount in spatial frequency. Main effect: there was a significant (ANOVA) sex difference. Across the entire spatio-temporal domain, males were more sensitive, especially at higher spatial frequencies; similarly males had significantly better acuity at all temporal rates.

CONCLUSION

As with other sensory systems, there are marked sex differences in vision. The CSFs we measure are largely determined by inputs from specific sets of thalamic neurons to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from thalamus to cortex is guided by cortex during embryogenesis. We suggest that testosterone plays a major role, leading to different connectivities in males and in females. But, for whatever reasons, we find that males have significantly greater sensitivity for fine detail and for rapidly moving stimuli. One interpretation is that this is consistent with sex roles in hunter-gatherer societies.},

However, the response to an optimally oriented stimulus presented within the RF can be enhanced by the simultaneous presentation of co-oriented, co-linearly aligned flank stimuli falling outside the RF which, when presented alone, fail to activate the cell. This type of contextual effect, termed colinear facilitation, presumably forms the physiological substrate for the integration of the line elements of a contour and the perceptual saliency of a contour in a complex environment. Here we show that colinear facilitation in single cells of cat area V1 can be substantially reduced or abolished by focal inactivation of laterally remote cells in the same area which respond strongly to the co-oriented, colinear flank stimulus inducing the facilitatory effect. The results provide evidence that horizontal intrinsic connections between cells with co-oriented and co-linearly aligned RFs make a major contribution to colinear facilitation in V1. They imply that the neuronal circuitry underlying contour integration and saliency is already present at the earliest stage of visual cortical information processing.},

Recordings from V1 showed that 42\% of complex cells demonstrated facilitation for a second bar outside their classical receptive fields with a similar dependency on relative location and orientation. Both effects were eliminated by an orthogonal line between the two iso-oriented lines.

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0014543},
  abstract = {Background
One common criterion for classifying electrophysiological brain responses is based on the distinction between transient (i.e. event-related potentials, ERPs) and steady-state responses (SSRs). The generation of SSRs is usually attributed to the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the stimulus train. However, a more parsimonious account suggests that SSRs might result from the linear addition of the transient responses elicited by each stimulus. This study aimed to investigate this possibility.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We recorded brain potentials elicited by a checkerboard stimulus reversing at different rates. We modeled SSRs by sequentially shifting and linearly adding rate-specific ERPs. Our results show a strong resemblance between recorded and synthetic SSRs, supporting the superposition hypothesis. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of entrainment of a neural oscillation at the stimulation frequency.

Conclusions/Significance
This study provides evidence that visual SSRs can be explained as a superposition of transient ERPs. These findings have critical implications in our current understanding of brain oscillations. Contrary to the idea that neural networks can be tuned to a wide range of frequencies, our findings rather suggest that the oscillatory response of a given neural network is constrained within its natural frequency range.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry and cross-orientation suppression are well-studied forms of competition in visual cortex, but models of these two types of competition are in tension with one another. Binocular rivalry occurs during the presentation of dichoptic grating stimuli, where two orthogonal gratings presented separately to the two eyes evoke strong alternations in perceptual dominance. Cross-orientation suppression occurs during the presentation of plaid stimuli, where the responses to a component grating presented to both eyes is weakened by the presence of a superimposed orthogonal grating. Conventional models of rivalry that rely on strong competition between orientation-selective neurons incorrectly predict rivalry between the components of plaids. Lowering the inhibitory weights in such models reduces rivalry for plaids, but also reduces it for dichoptic gratings. Using an exhaustive grid search, we show that this problem cannot be solved simply by adjusting the parameters of the model. Instead, we propose a robust class of models that rely on ocular opponency neurons, previously proposed as a mechanism for efficient stereo coding, to yield rivalry only for dichoptic gratings, not for plaids. This class of models reconciles models of binocular rivalry with the divisive normalization framework that has been used to explain cross-orientation. Our model makes novel predictions that we confirmed with psychophysical tests., Binocular rivalry is a visual illusion that occurs when the two eyes are presented with incompatible images. Instead of perceiving a mixture of the two images, most people tend to experiences alternations in which they only see one image at a time. Binocular rivalry is more than just an interesting illusion: it reflects actual competition between neurons in the brain, and therefore provides a rare window into neural dynamics. To help us understand these mechanisms, researchers have developed several computational models of binocular rivalry. Yet surprisingly, as we show in this paper, previous computational models of rivalry make an incorrect prediction. They predict that certain types of images (similar to checkerboards) will cause strong perceptual alternations even when viewed normally. Since this prediction doesn't hold up, the existing models must not be telling the whole story. In this paper, we develop a new model of binocular rivalry that doesn't make this prediction. The model also makes novel predictions \textendash{} not made by conventional models \textendash{} that stand up to experimental test. Our model thus provides a better account of how neurons in the visual system interact with one another.},

Almost all increases in thresholds with eccentricity were explained by the theory in five of these tasks, which included the two-dot vernier hyperacuity test, the measurement of visual acuities with gratings, the Snellen E test, and two acuity tests that required either separation between dots or discrimination between two mirror-symmetric forms. The two-dot vernier thresholds could be explained as a special case of orientation discrimination, and orientation discrimination at different eccentricities was in agreement with the cortical magnification theory. The increase of thresholds in peripheral vision was larger than predicted by the theory in the Landolt visual acuity and bisection hyperacuity tests, possibly because of retinal undersampling.},

To test these proposals, we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) after local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABA(A) antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300\%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model in which GABA(A) inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABA(A) inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

  abstract = {The receive field of MRI imparts an image contrast which is spatially fixed relative to the receive coil. If motion correction is used to correct subject motion occurring during an EPI time series then the receiver contrast will effectively move relative to the subject and produce temporal modulations in the image amplitude. This effect, which we will call the RFC-MoCo effect, may have consequences in the analysis and interpretation of fMRI results. There are many potential causes of motion-related noise and systematic error in EPI time series and isolating the RFC-MoCo effect would be difficult. Therefore, we have undertaken a simulation of this effect to better understand its severity. The simulations examine this effect for a receive-only single-channel 16-leg birdcage coil and a receive-only 12-channel phased array. In particular we study: (1) The effect size; (2) Its consequences to the temporal correlations between signals arising at different spatial locations (spatial-temporal correlations) as is often calculated in resting state fMRI analyses; and (3) Its impact on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of an EPI time series. We find that signal changes arising from the RFC-MoCo effect are likely to compete with BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal changes in the presence of significant motion, even under the assumption of perfect motion correction. Consequently, we find that the RFC-MoCo effect may lead to spurious temporal correlations across the image space, and that temporal SNR may be degraded with increasing motion.},

  abstract = {The magnocellular (M) pathway hypothesis proposes that impaired visual motion perception observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) might be mediated by atypical functioning of the subcortical M pathway, as this pathway provides the bulk of visual input to cortical motion detectors. To test this hypothesis, we measured luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity, thought to tap M and Parvocellular (P) pathway processing, respectively. We also tested the hypothesis that motion processing is impaired in ASD using a novel paradigm that measures motion processing while controlling for detectabilty. Specifically, this paradigm compares contrast sensitivity for detection of a moving grating with contrast sensitivity for direction-of-motion discrimination of that same moving grating. Contrast sensitivities from adolescents with ASD were compared to typically-developing adolescents, and also unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD (SIBS). The results revealed significant group differences on P, but not M, pathway processing, with SIBS showing higher chromatic contrast sensitivity than both participants with ASD and TD participants. This atypicality, unique to SIBS, suggests the possible existence of a protective factor in these individuals against developing ASD. The results also revealed impairments in motion perception in both participants with ASD and SIBS, which may be an endophenotype of ASD. This impairment may be driven by impairments in motion detectors and/or by reduced input from neural areas that project to motion detectors, the latter possibility being consistent with the notion of reduced connectivity between neural areas in ASD.},

The capacity of autistic individuals to form representations of previous sensory impressions, useful for the processing of present information, is impaired. Self-organizing feature maps are mathematical models of cortical feature maps and may be used to simulate cortical processing. Dysfunctional self-organization, resulting in disability to extract features from stimuli, is proposed as a neural circuit theory of autism. The nature and a possible cause of dysfunction self-organization are examined. It is shown that impaired feature detection is valid for explaining the memory function in autism, the lack of drive for central coherence according to Frith's theory of autism, and a number of impairments from the diagnostic criteria. Unequal levels of impairment of different cortical feature maps can account for the typically uneven intelligence profile of autistic individuals. Excessive inhibitory lateral feedback synaptic connection strengths are presented as one factor impairing the development of feature maps. Strong or excessive inhibitory lateral feedback synaptic connection strengths also cause high sensory discrimination and abnormal sensory responses, both documented in autism. A neural circuit theory for autism has been presented. For a proof of this neural circuit theory neurological investigations are required.},

Subjects reported the orientation (up/down/left/right) of a T target, abutted by a single flanker composed of randomly positioned horizontal and vertical bars. In addition to familiar retinotopic anisotropies (e.g., more crowding from more eccentric flankers), we report three object-centered anisotropies. First, inversions of the target element were rare: errors included twice as many $\pm$90$^\circ$ as 180$^\circ$ target rotations. Second, flankers were twice as intrusive when they lay above or below (end-flanking) compared to left or right (side-flanking) of an upright T target (an effect that holds under global rotation of the target\textendash{}flanker pair). Third, end flankers induce subjects to make erroneous reports that resemble the flanker (producing a structured pattern of errors), but errors induced by side flankers do not (instead producing random errors). A model based on probabilistic weighted averaging of the feature positions within contours can account for these effects. Thus, we demonstrate a set of seemingly ``high-level'' object-centered crowding effects that can arise from ``low-level'' interactions between the features of letter-like elements.},

  abstract = {Summary 
Crowding is the breakdown in object recognition that occurs in cluttered visual environments [1\textendash{}4] and the fundamental limit on peripheral vision, affecting identification within many visual modalities [5\textendash{}9] and across large spatial regions [10]. Though frequently characterized as a disruptive process through which object representations are suppressed [11, 12] or lost altogether [13\textendash{}15], we demonstrate that crowding systematically changes the appearance of objects. In particular, target patches of visual noise that are surrounded (``crowded'') by oriented Gabor flankers become perceptually oriented, matching the flankers. This was established with a change-detection paradigm: under crowded conditions, target changes from noise to Gabor went unnoticed when the Gabor orientation matched the flankers (and the illusory target percept), despite being easily detected when they differed. Rotation of the flankers (leaving target noise unaltered) also induced illusory target rotations. Blank targets led to similar results, demonstrating that crowding can induce apparent structure where none exists. Finally, adaptation to these stimuli induced a tilt aftereffect at the target location, consistent with signals from the flankers ``spreading'' across space. These results confirm predictions from change-based models of crowding, such as averaging [16], and establish crowding as a regularization process that simplifies the peripheral field by promoting consistent appearance among adjacent objects.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry is a visual phenomenon in which perception alternates between two different monocular images presented to each of the two eyes. Here, we propose using this phenomenon as a method to study the relation between action execution and action perception. In our experiment, a simple background (a checkerboard) was contrasted with a video representing a hand continuously grasping and releasing a ball. In Experiment 1, our subjects were asked to reproduce the perceived movement with their right hand whenever they became aware of it and to stop doing this when the checkerboard dominated. Our results revealed that motor imitation of the perceived action significantly increased the time spent perceiving the hand. Three control experiments showed that these effects were not due to a generic involvement of focused attention (Experiment 2 and 3), to a verbal description of the performed action (Experiment 3) or to the execution of an unrelated movement of the hand (Experiment 4). Although an intrinsic connection between action execution and attention cannot be excluded with certainty, and the boundary between action imitation and unrelated action execution may vary along various degrees of similarity, on the whole, the present results seem to suggest, at least on a preliminary basis, that action imitation do play a relevant role in the perception of action. We discuss these findings in the frame of current theories concerning the relation between perception and action.},

  abstract = {Intravenous injections of cocaine HCl are habit-forming because, among their many actions, they elevate extracellular dopamine levels in the terminal fields of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. This action, thought to be very important for cocaine's strong addiction liability, is believed to have very short latency and is assumed to reflect rapid brain entry and pharmacokinetics of the drug. However, while intravenous cocaine HCl has almost immediate effects on behavior and extracellular dopamine levels, recent evidence suggests that its central pharmacological effects are not evident until 10 or more seconds after IV injection. Thus the immediate effects of a given intravenous cocaine injection on extracellular dopamine concentration and behavior appear to occur before there is sufficient time for cocaine to act centrally as a dopamine uptake inhibitor. To explore the contribution of peripheral effects of cocaine to the early activation of the dopamine system, we used brain microdialysis to measure the effects of cocaine methiodide (MI)\textendash{}a cocaine analogue that does not cross the blood brain barrier\textendash{}on glutamate (excitatory) input to the dopamine cells. IP injections of cocaine MI were ineffective in cocaine-na{\"\i}ve animals but stimulated ventral tegmental glutamate release in rats previously trained to lever-press for cocaine HCl. This peripherally triggered glutamate input was sufficient to reinstate cocaine-seeking in previously trained animals that had undergone extinction of the habit. These findings offer an explanation for short-latency behavioral responses and immediate dopamine elevations seen following cocaine injections in cocaine-experienced but not cocaine-na{\"\i}ve animals.},

  doi = {10.1167/4.12.12},
  abstract = {A letter in the peripheral visual field is much harder to identify in the presence of nearby letters. This is ``crowding.'' Both crowding and ordinary masking are special cases of ``masking,'' which, in general, refers to any effect of a ``mask'' pattern on the discriminability of a signal. Here we characterize crowding, and propose a diagnostic test to distinguish it from ordinary masking. In ordinary masking, the signal disappears. In crowding, it remains visible, but is ambiguous, jumbled with its neighbors. Masks are usually effective only if they overlap the signal, but the crowding effect extends over a large region. The width of that region is proportional to signal eccentricity from the fovea and independent of signal size, mask size, mask contrast, signal and mask font, and number of masks. At 4 deg eccentricity, the threshold contrast for identification of a 0.32 deg signal letter is elevated (up to six-fold) by mask letters anywhere in a 2.3 deg region, 7 times wider than the signal. In ordinary masking, threshold contrast rises as a power function of mask contrast, with a shallow log-log slope of 0.5 to 1, whereas, in crowding, threshold is a sigmoidal function of mask contrast, with a steep log-log slope of 2 at close spacing. Most remarkably, although the threshold elevation decreases exponentially with spacing, the threshold and saturation contrasts of crowding are independent of spacing. Finally, ordinary masking is similar for detection and identification, but crowding occurs only for identification, not detection. More precisely, crowding occurs only in tasks that cannot be done based on a single detection by coarsely coded feature detectors. These results (and observers' introspections) suggest that ordinary masking blocks feature detection, so the signal disappears, while crowding (like ``illusory conjunction'') is excessive feature integration \textemdash{} detected features are integrated over an inappropriately large area because there are no smaller integration fields \textemdash{} so the integrated signal is ambiguous, jumbled with the mask. In illusory conjunction, observers see an object that is not there made up of features that are. A survey of the illusory conjunction literature finds that most of the illusory conjunction results are consistent with the spatial crowding described here, which depends on spatial proximity, independent of time pressure. The rest seem to arise through a distinct phenomenon that one might call ``temporal crowding,'' which depends on time pressure (``overloading attention''), independent of spatial proximity.},

We manipulated the apparent separation of objects using the illusory shifts in perceived location that arise from local motion to determine if crowding depends on physical or perceived location. Flickering Gabor targets displayed between either flickering or drifting flankers were used to (a) quantify the perceived target\textendash{}flanker separation and (b) measure discrimination of the target orientation or spatial frequency as a function of physical target\textendash{}flanker separation. Relative to performance with flickering targets, we find that flankers drifting away from the target improve discrimination, while those drifting toward the target degrade it. When plotted as a function of perceived separation across conditions, the data collapse onto a single function indicating that it is perceived and not physical location that determines the magnitude of visual crowding. There was no measurable spatial distortion of the target that could explain the effects. This suggests that crowding operates predominantly in extrastriate visual cortex and not in early visual areas where the response of neurons is retinotopically aligned with the physical position of a stimulus.},

  abstract = {Under conditions in which the visual system can not reconcile dissimilar images from the two eyes, perception typically alternates between the two images - a process known as binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry is a useful experimental paradigm for identifying aspects of neural correlates. Two images flickered at different frequencies as the visual stimulator to left and right eyes respectively so that the response can be recovered from the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) by time-frequency analysis. SSVEP-based binocular rivalry has potential advantage of registering the alternation in physiological dominance of the two eyes. However, flickering frequency greatly affects its practical applications. This paper presents a method of frequency selection to improve the applicability of SSVEP-based binocular rivalry. Optimal frequency is selected by comparing the stability and the signal-to-noise ratio of SSVEP between different frequencies. The SSVEP-based binocular rivalry with optimal flickering frequency correlates better with the subjects' report of perceptual dominance},

Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through positive allosteric modulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors impaired social behavior in C57BL/6J and 129SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits.

However, the importance of neural adaptation for producing perceptual alterations has been challenged in several articles (; ). We devised an ``online'' adaptation procedure to reexamine the role of adaptation in binocular rivalry. Periods of adaptation inserted into rivalry observation periods parametrically alter the dynamics of rivalry such that increased adaptation duration decreases dominance duration, which cannot be accounted for by neural noise. Analysis of the average dominance durations and their variance (coefficient of variation) provides evidence for an increasingly important role of noise in rivalry alternations as a given dominance period continues in time, consistent with recent computational models.},

  abstract = {Previous behavioral research suggests enhanced local visual processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here we used functional MRI and population receptive field (pRF) analysis to test whether the response selectivity of human visual cortex is atypical in individuals with high-functioning ASDs compared with neurotypical, demographically matched controls. For each voxel, we fitted a pRF model to fMRI signals measured while participants viewed flickering bar stimuli traversing the visual field. In most extrastriate regions, perifoveal pRFs were larger in the ASD group than in controls. We observed no differences in V1 or V3A. Differences in the hemodynamic response function, eye movements, or increased measurement noise could not account for these results; individuals with ASDs showed stronger, more reliable responses to visual stimulation. Interestingly, pRF sizes also correlated with individual differences in autistic traits but there were no correlations with behavioral measures of visual processing. Our findings thus suggest that visual cortex in ASDs is not characterized by sharper spatial selectivity. Instead, we speculate that visual cortical function in ASDs may be characterized by extrastriate cortical hyperexcitability or differential attentional deployment.},

Here we test a potential resolution derived from the Load Theory of Attention (e.g., Lavie, 2005). In Load Theory, distractor processing depends on the perceptual load of the task and as such can only be eliminated under high load that engages full capacity. We hypothesize that ASD involves enhanced perceptual capacity, leading to the superior performance and increased distractor processing previously reported. Using a signal-detection paradigm, we test this directly and demonstrate that, under higher levels of load, perceptual sensitivity was reduced in typical adults but not in adults with ASD. These findings confirm our hypothesis and offer a promising solution to the previous discrepancies by suggesting that increased distractor processing in ASD results not from a filtering deficit but from enhanced perceptual capacity.},

Although it is important to study the pathophysiology of ASD in the developing cortex, the functional connectivity in the brains of young children with ASD has not been well studied. In the present study, brain activity was measured non-invasively during consciousness in 50 young human children with ASD and 50 age- and gender-matched typically developing human (TD) children. We employed a custom child-sized magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in which sensors were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in young children. We focused on theta band oscillations because they are thought to be involved in long-range networks associated with higher cognitive processes. The ASD group showed significantly reduced connectivity between the left anterior and the right posterior areas, exhibiting a decrease in the coherence of theta band (6 Hz) oscillations compared with the TD group. This reduction in coherence was significantly correlated with clinical severity in right-handed children with ASD. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced long-range functional connectivity in conscious young children with ASD using a novel MEG approach.},

Most existing models assume that switches arise from a slow fatiguing process, such as adaptation or synaptic depression. We develop a new, attractor-based framework in which alternations are induced by noise and are absent without it. Our model goes beyond previous energy-based conceptualizations of perceptual bistability by constructing a neurally plausible attractor model that is implemented in both firing rate mean-field and spiking cell-based networks. The model accounts for known properties of bistable perceptual phenomena, most notably the increase in alternation rate with stimulation strength observed in binocular rivalry. Furthermore, it makes a novel prediction about the effect of changing stimulus strength on the activity levels of the dominant and suppressed neural populations, a prediction that could be tested with functional MRI or electrophysiological recordings. The neural architecture derived from the energy-based model readily generalizes to several competing populations, providing a natural extension for multistability phenomena.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0010582},
  abstract = {Background
Cast shadows in visual scenes can have profound effects on visual perception. Much as they are informative, they also constitute noise as they are salient features of the visual scene potentially interfering with the processing of other features. Here we asked i) whether individuals with autism can exploit the information conveyed by cast shadows; ii) whether they are especially sensitive to noise aspects of shadows.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Twenty high-functioning children with autism and twenty typically developing children were asked to recognize familiar objects while the presence, position, and shape of the cast shadow were systematically manipulated. Analysis of vocal reaction time revealed that whereas typically developing children used information from cast shadows to improve object recognition, in autistic children the presence of cast shadows\textemdash{}either congruent or incongruent\textemdash{}interfered with object recognition. Critically, vocal reaction times were faster when the object was presented without a cast shadow.

Conclusions/Significance
We conclude that shadow-processing mechanisms are abnormal in autism. As a result, processing shadows becomes costly and cast shadows interfere rather than help object recognition.},

In multiple experiments using a number of different stimulus patterns (e.g., letter Cs, letter Ts, and parallel/nonparallel line segments), results consistently showed that the crowding effect was significantly stronger when the target and distractors were horizontally rather than vertically arranged. Such a horizontal versus vertical asymmetry was found in all four quadrants of visual space. Importantly, a further visual acuity test did not reveal a horizontal versus vertical asymmetric effect.},

This complex architecture poses difficulties for attempts to link perceptual phenomena to activity at a particular level of the system. This difficulty has been especially salient in studies of binocular rivalry alternations, where there is seemingly conflicting evidence for a locus in primary visual cortex or alternatively in higher cortical areas devoted to object perception. Here, I use a competitive neural model to demonstrate that the data require at least two hierarchic rivalry stages for their explanation. This model demonstrates that competitive inhibition in the first rivalry stage can be eliminated by using suitable stimulus dynamics, thereby revealing properties of a later stage, a result obtained with both spike-rate and conductance-based model neurons. This result provides a synthesis of competing rivalry theories and suggests that neural competition may be a general characteristic throughout the form-vision hierarchy.},

The readoption of the parsimonious position that many aspects of autism stem from one underlying deficit is suggested. It is argued that the question then becomes whether this deficit is a weakening of central-coherence mechanisms or whether weak central coherence "effects" may be better explained by alternative mechanisms. This questions is answered by reviewing studies that have assessed the weak central coherence hypothesis at the level of perception and selective attention. It is argued that there is an alternative explanation of the perceptual and attentional abnormalities in autism to weak central coherence that pivots on the notion that individuals with autism are unable to draw pieces of information together because of an inability to recognize the similarities between stimuli or situations. Ways in which a reduced ability to process similarity at the perceptual and attentional level (of the kind observed in autism) can lead to abnormalities at the conceptual level are offered.},

Whereas the flankers' brightness had no effect on and cueing only slightly reduced the lateral masking effects, it was substantially reduced by avoiding the abrupt on- and offset of the flankers.

  abstract = {In the present study, copying tasks were used to assess hierarchical aspects of visual perception in a group of 10 nonsavant autistic individuals with normal intelligence. In Experiment 1, the hierarchical order of graphic construction and the constancy of this order were measured for the copying of objects and nonobjects. In comparison to control participants, autistic individuals produced more local features at the start of the copying. However, they did not differ from controls with respect to graphic constancy. Experiment 2 measured the effect of geometrical impossibility on the copying of figures. Results revealed that autistic individuals were less affected by figure impossibility than were controls. Therefore, these experiments seem to support the notion of a local bias for visual information processing in individuals with autism. Two interpretations are proposed to account for this effect. According to the hierarchical deficit hypothesis, individuals with autism do not manifest the normal global bias in perceiving scenes and objects. Alternatively, the executive function hypothesis suggests that autism brings about limitations in the complexity of information that can be manipulated in short-term visual memory during graphic planning.},

We (Danckert et al. in Neglect as a disorder of representational updating. NOVA Open Access, New York, 2012a; Cereb Cortex 22:2745\textendash{}2760, 2012b) were the first to directly assess the association between RBD and updating and found that RBD patients were unable to exploit a strongly biased play strategy in their opponent in the children's game rock, paper, scissors. Given that this game required many other cognitive capacities (i.e., working memory, sustained attention, reward processing), RBD patients could have failed this task for various reasons other than a failure to update. To assess the generality of updating deficits after RBD, we had RBD, left brain-damaged (LBD) patients and healthy controls (HCs) describe line drawings that evolved gradually from one figure (e.g., rabbit) to another (e.g., duck) in addition to the RPS updating task. RBD patients took significantly longer to alter their perceptual report from the initial object to the final object than did LBD patients and HCs. Although both patient groups performed poorly on the RPS task, only the RBD patients showed a significant correlation between the two, very different, updating tasks. We suggest these data indicate a general deficiency in the ability to update mental representations following RBD.},

  abstract = {Atypical high-level vision in autism is sometimes attributed to a core deficit in the function of lateral geniculate nucleus magnocells or their retinal drives. While some physiological measures provide indirect, suggestive evidence for such a deficit, support from behavioural measures is lacking and contradictory. We assessed luminance contrast increment thresholds on pulsed- and steady- pedestals in 17 children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) compared to 17 typically developing children; these two conditions correspond to widely-used indices of magnocellular and parvocellular function. As a group, children with ASC had strikingly elevated thresholds on the steady pedestal-paradigm, yet performed similarly to controls on the pulsed pedestal paradigm, a finding that would typically be interpreted to reflect impaired magnocellular function. The effect size of the impairment was large and a substantial minority (41.2\%) of the ASC group showed significantly impaired performance on an individual basis. This finding is consistent with a selective magnocellular deficit. It directly contradicts previous claims that such deficits are confined to `complex' visual stimuli and likely does not reflect atypical attention, adaptation or high-level vision. The pattern of results is not clearly predicted by notions of imbalance of excitation versus inhibition, atypical lateral connectivity or enhanced perceptual function that account for a range of other findings associated with perception in autism. It may be amenable to explanation in terms of decreased endogenous neural noise, a novel alternative we outline here.},

A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

Currently though, there is very little known about the visual search skills of very young children (1\textendash{}3-year-olds) \textendash{} either typically developing or with ASD. We used an eye-tracker to measure looking behavior, providing fine-grained measures of visual search in 2.5-year-old toddlers with and without ASD (this representing the age by which many children may first receive a diagnosis of ASD). Importantly, our paradigm required no verbal instructions or feedback, making the task appropriate for toddlers who are pre- or nonverbal. We found that toddlers with ASD were more successful at finding the target than typically developing, age-matched controls. Further, our paradigm allowed us to estimate the number of items scrutinized per trial, revealing that for large set size conjunctive search, toddlers with ASD scrutinized as many as twice the number of items as typically developing toddlers, in the same amount of time.},

  abstract = {An object or feature is generally more difficult to identify when other objects are presented nearby, an effect referred to as crowding. Here, we used Mooney faces to examine whether crowding can also occur within and between holistic face representations (C. M. Mooney, 1957). Mooney faces are ideal stimuli for this test because no cues exist to distinguish facial features in a Mooney face; to find any facial feature, such as an eye or a nose, one must first holistically perceive the image as a face. Through a series of six experiments we tested the effect of crowding on Mooney face recognition. Our results demonstrate crowding between and within Mooney faces and fulfill the diagnostic criteria for crowding, including eccentricity dependence and lack of crowding in the fovea, critical flanker spacing consistent with less than half the eccentricity of the target, and inner-outer flanker asymmetry. Further, our results show that recognition of an upright Mooney face is more strongly impaired by upright Mooney face flankers than inverted ones. Taken together, these results suggest crowding can occur selectively between high-level representations of faces and that crowding must occur at multiple levels in the visual system.},

  abstract = {When viewing a stimulus that has multiple plausible real-world interpretations, perception alternates between these interpretations every few seconds. Alternations can be halted by intermittently removing the stimulus from view. The same interpretation dominates over many successive presentations, and perception stabilizes. Here we study perception during long sessions of such intermittent presentation. We demonstrate that, rather than causing truly stable perception, intermittent presentation gives rise to a perceptual alternation cycle with its own characteristics and dependencies, different from those during continuous presentation. Alternations during intermittent viewing typically occur once every few minutes\textemdash{}much less frequently than the seconds-scale alternations during continuous viewing. Strikingly, alternations during intermittent viewing occur at fairly regular intervals, making for a surprisingly periodic alternation cycle. The duration of this cycle becomes longer as the blank duration between presentations is increased, reaching dozens of minutes in some cases. We interpret our findings in terms of a mathematical model that describes a neural network with competition between alternative interpretations. Network sensitivities depend on prior dominance, thus providing a memory for past perception. Slow changes in sensitivity produce both perceptual stabilization and the regular but infrequent alternations, meaning that the same memory traces are responsible for both. This model provides a good description of psychophysical findings, and offers several indications regarding their neural basis.},

When we move our eyes, images of objects are displaced on the retina, yet the visual world appears stable. Oculomotor activity just prior to an eye movement contributes to perceptual stability by providing information about the predicted location of a relevant object on the retina following a saccade [1, 2]. It remains unclear, however, whether an object's features are represented at the remapped location. Here, we exploited the phenomenon of visual crowding [3] to show that presaccadic remapping preserves the elementary features of objects at their predicted postsaccadic locations. Observers executed an eye movement and identified a letter probe flashed just before the saccade. Flanking stimuli were flashed around the location that would be occupied by the probe immediately following the saccade. Despite being positioned in the opposite visual field to the~probe, these flankers disrupted observers' ability to identify the probe. Crucially, this ``remapped crowding'' interference was stronger when the flankers were visually similar to the probe than when the flanker and probe stimuli were distinct. Our findings suggest that visual processing at remapped locations is featurally dependent, providing a mechanism for achieving perceptual continuity of objects across saccades.},

  abstract = {Summary 
Sometimes, perception fluctuates spontaneously between two distinct interpretations of a constant sensory input. These bistable perceptual phenomena provide a unique window into the neural mechanisms that create the contents of conscious perception [1]. Models of bistable perception posit that mutual inhibition between stimulus-selective neural populations in visual cortex plays a key role in these spontaneous perceptual fluctuations [2, 3]. However, a direct link between neural inhibition and bistable perception has not yet been established experimentally. Here, we link perceptual dynamics in three distinct bistable visual illusions (binocular rivalry, motion-induced blindness, and structure from motion) to measurements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in human visual cortex (as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and to pharmacological stimulation of the GABAA receptor by means of lorazepam. As predicted by a model of neural interactions underlying bistability, both higher GABA concentrations in visual cortex and lorazepam administration induced slower perceptual dynamics, as reflected in a reduced number of perceptual switches and a lengthening of percept durations. Thus, we show that GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, shapes the dynamics of bistable perception. These results pave the way for future studies into the competitive neural interactions across the visual cortical hierarchy that elicit conscious perception.},

  abstract = {Attention filters behaviorally relevant stimuli from the constant stream of sensory information comprising our environment. Research into underlying neural mechanisms in humans suggests that visual attention biases mutual suppression between stimuli resulting from competition for limited processing resources. As a consequence, processing of an attended stimulus is facilitated. This account makes 2 assumptions: 1) An attended stimulus is released from mutual suppression with competing stimuli and 2) an attended stimulus experiences greater gain in the presence of competing stimuli than when it is presented alone. Here, we tested these assumptions by recording frequency-tagged potentials elicited in early visual cortex that index stimulus-specific processing. We contrasted the processing of a given stimulus when its location was attended or unattended and in the presence or the absence of a nearby competing stimulus. At variance with previous findings, competition similarly suppressed processing of attended and unattended stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude of attentional gain was comparable in the presence or the absence of competing stimuli. We conclude that visuospatial selective attention does not directly modulate mutual suppression between stimuli but instead acts as a signal gain, which biases processing toward attended stimuli independent of competition.},

Adults with (n = 221) and without (n = 181) autism spectrum conditions participated in an online survey. The Autism Spectrum Quotient, the Raven Matrices and the Sensory Processing Scale were used to characterize the sample. Adults with autism spectrum conditions reported more sensory over-responsivity than control participants across various sensory domains (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory and proprioceptive). Sensory over-responsivity correlated positively with autistic traits (Autism Spectrum Quotient) at a significant level across groups and within groups. Adults with autism spectrum conditions experience sensory over-responsivity to daily sensory stimuli to a high degree. A positive relationship exists between sensory over-responsivity and autistic traits. Understanding sensory over-responsivity and ways of measuring it in adults with autism spectrum conditions has implications for research and clinical settings.},

Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.},

  abstract = {When visual input is inconclusive, does previous experience aid the visual system in attaining an accurate perceptual interpretation? Prolonged viewing of a visually ambiguous stimulus causes perception to alternate between conflicting interpretations. When viewed intermittently, however, ambiguous stimuli tend to evoke the same percept on many consecutive presentations. This perceptual stabilization has been suggested to reflect persistence of the most recent percept throughout the blank that separates two presentations. Here we show that the memory trace that causes stabilization reflects not just the latest percept, but perception during a much longer period. That is, the choice between competing percepts at stimulus reappearance is determined by an elaborate history of prior perception. Specifically, we demonstrate a seconds-long influence of the latest percept, as well as a more persistent influence based on the relative proportion of dominance during a preceding period of at least one minute. In case short-term perceptual history and long-term perceptual history are opposed (because perception has recently switched after prolonged stabilization), the long-term influence recovers after the effect of the latest percept has worn off, indicating independence between time scales. We accommodate these results by adding two positive adaptation terms, one with a short time constant and one with a long time constant, to a standard model of perceptual switching.},

In crowding, flanking objects make the target unidentifiable. However, to date, the two tasks have only been studied separately. K. A. May and R. F. Hess (2007) suggested that the same binding mediates both tasks. To test this idea, we ask observers to perform two different tasks with the same stimulus. We present oriented grating patches that form a ``snake letter'' in the periphery. Observers report either the identity of the whole letter (contour integration task) or the phase of one of the grating patches (crowding task). We manipulate the strength of binding between gratings by varying the alignment between them, i.e., the Gestalt goodness of continuation, measured as ``wiggle.'' We find that better alignment strengthens binding, which improves contour integration and worsens crowding. Observers show equal sensitivity to alignment in these two very different tasks, suggesting that the same binding mechanism underlies both phenomena. It has been claimed that grouping among flankers reduces their crowding of the target. Instead, we find that these published cases of weak crowding are due to weak binding resulting from target\textendash{}flanker misalignment. We conclude that crowding is mediated solely by the grouping of flankers with the target and is independent of grouping among flankers.},

During delivery and subsequently, hippocampal neurons in these models have elevated intracellular chloride levels, increased excitatory GABA, enhanced glutamatergic activity, and elevated gamma oscillations. Maternal pretreatment with bumetanide restored in offspring control electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. Conversely, blocking oxytocin signaling in na{\"\i}ve mothers produced offspring having electrophysiological and behavioral autistic-like features. Our results suggest a chronic deficient chloride regulation in these rodent models of autism and stress the importance of oxytocin-mediated GABAergic inhibition during the delivery process. Our data validate the amelioration observed with bumetanide and oxytocin and point to common pathways in a drug-induced and a genetic rodent model of autism.
The Switch That Doesn't
In mammals, a class of neurons in the brain normally switches from excitatory to inhibitory functions at birth. Tyzio et al. (p. 675; see the Perspective by Zimmerman and Connors) studied how these neurons function in rat and mouse models of autism. The results show that oxytocin normally accelerates the switch in function, but in these two animal models, the switch fails. The dysfunction could be replicated in normal animals using an oxytocin receptor antagonist.},

Many hypotheses for the underlying neurophysiological basis have been proposed. Among these is the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance hypothesis, which states that levels of cortical excitation and inhibition are disrupted in autism. We tested this theory in the visual system, because vision is one of the better understood systems in neuroscience, and because the E/I imbalance theory has been proposed to explain hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli in autism. We conducted two experiments on binocular rivalry, a well-studied psychophysical phenomenon that depends critically on excitation and inhibition levels in cortex. Using a computational model, we made specific predictions about how imbalances in excitation and inhibition levels would affect perception of two aspects of binocular rivalry: mixed perception (Experiment 1) and traveling waves (Experiment 2). We found no significant differences in either of these phenomena between high-functioning adults with autism and controls, and no evidence for a relationship between these measurements and the severity of autism. These results do not conclusively rule out an excitation/inhibition imbalance in visual system of those with autism, but they suggest that such an imbalance, if it exists, is likely to be small in magnitude.},

Here, we ask if this effect might be a manifestation of visual crowding (the disruptive influence of ``visual clutter'' on object recognition). We first report that the effect generalizes to simple contour-localization (without explicit shape-discrimination) and influences tolerance to orientation jitter in the same way it affects threshold exposure-duration. We next directly examined the role of crowding by quantifying observers' local uncertainty (about the orientation of the elements that comprised our contours), showing that this largely accounts for the effects of context on global contour integration. These findings support the idea that context influences contour integration at a predominantly local stage of processing and that the local effects of crowding eventually influence downstream stages in the cortical processing of visual form.},

However, inconsistent findings make the nature of this relationship unclear and thus, we examined the role of stimulus-driven transient attention, presumably activated by the dorsal stream in autistic tendency. Contrast thresholds for object discrimination were compared between groups with high and low self-rated autistic tendency utilizing the socially based Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Visual stimuli were presented with either abrupt or with ramped contrast onsets/offsets in order to manipulate the demands of transient attention. Larger impairments in performance of abrupt compared with ramped object presentation were established in the high AQ group. Furthermore, self-reported social skills predicted abrupt task performance, suggesting an important visual perception deficiency in autism-related traits. Autism spectrum disorder may be associated with reduced utilization of the dorsal stream to rapidly activate attention prior to ventral stream processing when stimuli are transient.

  abstract = {Background. The rate of binocular rivalry has been reported to be slower in subjects with bipolar disorder than in controls when tested with drifting, vertical and horizontal gratings of high spatial frequency.Method. Here we assess the rate of binocular rivalry with stationary, vertical and horizontal gratings of low spatial frequency in 30 subjects with bipolar disorder, 30 age- and sex-matched controls, 18 subjects with schizophrenia and 18 subjects with major depression. Along with rivalry rate, the predominance of each of the rivaling images was assessed, as was the distribution of normalized rivalry intervals.Results. The bipolar group demonstrated significantly slower rivalry than the control, schizophrenia and major depression groups. The schizophrenia and major depression groups did not differ significantly from the control group. Predominance values did not differ according to diagnosis and the distribution of normalized rivalry intervals was well described by a gamma function in all groups.Conclusions. The results provide further evidence that binocular rivalry is slow in bipolar disorder and demonstrate that rivalry predominance and the distribution of normalized rivalry intervals are not abnormal in bipolar disorder. It is also shown by comparison with previous work, that high strength stimuli more effectively distinguish bipolar from control subjects than low strength stimuli. The data on schizophrenia and major depression suggest the need for large-scale specificity trials. Further study is also required to assess genetic and pathophysiological factors as well as the potential effects of state, medication, and clinical and biological subtypes.},

This hypothesis could unify diverse streams of pathophysiological and genetic evidence, but has not been susceptible to direct testing. Here we design and use several novel optogenetic tools to causally investigate the cellular E/I balance hypothesis in freely moving mammals, and explore the associated circuit physiology. Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80\,Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation. These results provide support for the elevated cellular E/I balance hypothesis of severe neuropsychiatric disease-related symptoms.},

  abstract = {Food intake is regulated by many factors, including sensory information, metabolic hormones and the state of hunger. In modern humans, the drive to eat has proven to be incompatible with the excess food supply present in industrialized societies. A result of this imbalance is the dramatically increased rates of obesity during the last 20 years. The rise in obesity rates poses one of the most significant public health issues facing the United States and yet we do not understand the neural basis of ingestive behavior, and specifically, our motivation to eat. Understanding how the brain controls eating will lay the foundation for systematic dissection, understanding and treatment of obesity and related disorders. The lack of control over food intake bears resemblance to drug addiction, where loss of control over behavior leads to compulsive drug use. Work in laboratory animals has long suggested that there exist common neural substrates underlying both food and drug intake behaviors. Recent studies have shown direct leptin effects on dopamine neuron function and behavior. This provides a new mechanism by which peripheral hormones influence behavior and contribute to a more comprehensive model of neural control over food intake.},

In the case of binocular rivalry, dissimilar monocular stimuli are presented to the two eyes for an extended period of time, whereas for stimulus rivalry the dissimilar monocular stimuli are exchanged rapidly and repetitively between the eyes during extended viewing. With both forms of rivalry, one experiences extended durations of exclusive perceptual dominance that fluctuate between the two stimuli. Whether these two forms of rivalry arise within different stages of visual processing has remained debatable. Using an individual-differences approach, we found that both stimulus rivalry and binocular rivalry exhibited same-shaped distributions of dominance durations among a sample of 30 observers and, moreover, that the dominance durations measured during binocular and stimulus rivalry were significantly correlated among our sample of observers. Furthermore, we found a significant, positive correlation between alternation rate in binocular rivalry and the incidence of stimulus rivalry. These results suggest that the two forms of rivalry may be tapping common neural mechanisms, or at least different mechanisms with comparable time constants. It remains to be learned just why the incidences of binocular rivalry and stimulus rivalry vary so greatly among people.},

We have compared the temporal frequency tuning and stimulus adaptation properties of monoptic and dichoptic COS. We found that dichoptic COS is best elicited with lower temporal frequencies and is substantially reduced after prolonged adaptation to a mask grating. In contrast, monoptic COS is more pronounced with mask gratings at much higher temporal frequencies and is less prone to stimulus adaptation. These results suggest that monoptic COS is mediated by subcortical mechanisms, whereas intracortical inhibition is the mechanism for dichoptic COS.},

  abstract = {Summary
An interocular conflict arises when different images are presented to each eye at the same spatial location. The visual system resolves this conflict through binocular rivalry: observers consciously perceive spontaneous alternations between the two images. Visual attention is generally important for resolving competition between neural representations. However, given the seemingly spontaneous and automatic nature of binocular rivalry, the role of attention in resolving interocular competition remains unclear. Here we test whether visual attention is necessary to~produce rivalry. Using an EEG frequency-tagging method to track cortical representations of the conflicting images, we show that when attention was diverted away, rivalry stopped. The EEG data further suggested that the neural representations of the dichoptic images combined without attention. Thus, attention is necessary for dichoptic images to be engaged in sustained rivalry and may be generally required for resolving conflicting, potentially ambiguous input and giving a single interpretation access to consciousness.},

Although most neuroimaging studies in ASD have been designed to identify commonalities among affected individuals, rather than differences, some studies have explored variation within ASD. There have been two general types of approaches used for this in the neuroimaging literature to date: comparison of subgroups within ASD, and analyses using dimensional measures to link clinical variation to brain differences. This review focuses on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that have used these approaches to begin to explore heterogeneity between individuals with ASD. Although this type of data is yet sparse, recognition is growing of the limitations of behaviorally defined categorical diagnoses for understanding neurobiology. Study designs that are more informative regarding the sources of heterogeneity in ASD have the potential to improve our understanding of the neurobiological processes underlying ASD.},

  abstract = {Objective
The steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) can be used to test the frequency response function of neural circuits. Previous studies have shown reduced SSVEPs to alpha and lower frequencies of stimulation in schizophrenia. We investigated SSVEPs in schizophrenia at frequencies spanning the theta (4 Hz) to gamma (40 Hz) range.
Methods
The SSVEPs to seven different frequencies of stimulation (4, 8, 17, 20, 23, 30 and 40 Hz) were obtained from 18 schizophrenia subjects and 33 healthy control subjects. Power at stimulating frequency (signal power) and power at frequencies above and below the stimulating frequency (noise power) were used to quantify the SSVEP responses.
Results
Both groups showed an inverse relationship between power and frequency of stimulation. Schizophrenia subjects showed reduced signal power compared to healthy control subjects at higher frequencies (above 17 Hz), but not at 4 and 8 Hz at occipital region. Noise power was higher in schizophrenia subjects at frequencies between 4 and 20 Hz over occipital region and at 4, 17 and 20 Hz over frontal region.
Conclusions
SSVEP signal power at beta and gamma frequencies of stimulation were reduced in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia subjects showed higher levels of EEG noise during photic stimulation at beta and lower frequencies.
Significance
Inability to generate or maintain oscillations in neural networks may contribute to deficits in visual processing in schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry (BR) is an intriguing phenomenon that occurs when two different images are presented, one to each eye, resulting in alternation or rivalry between the percepts. The phenomenon has been studied for nearly 200 years, with renewed and intensive investigation over recent decades. The rate of perceptual switching has long been known to vary widely between individuals but to be relatively stable within individuals. A recent twin study demonstrated that individual variation in BR rate is under substantial genetic control, a finding that also represented the first report, using a large study, of genetic contribution for any post-retinal visual processing phenomenon. The twin study had been prompted by earlier work showing BR rate was slow in the heritable psychiatric condition, bipolar disorder (BD). Together, these studies suggested that slow BR may represent an endophenotype for BD, and heralded the advent of modern clinical and genetic studies of rivalry. This new focus has coincided with rapid advances in 3D display technology, but despite such progress, specific development of technology for rivalry research has been lacking. This review therefore compares different display methods for BR research across several factors, including viewing parameters, image quality, equipment cost, compatibility with other investigative methods, subject group, and sample size, with a focus on requirements specific to large-scale clinical and genetic studies. It is intended to be a resource for investigators new to BR research, such as clinicians and geneticists, and to stimulate the development of 3D display technology for advancing interdisciplinary studies of rivalry.},

Here we show that despite their inability to report the orientation of an individual patch, observers can reliably estimate the average orientation, demonstrating that the local orientation signals are combined rather than lost. Our results imply that crowding is distinct from ordinary masking, and is perhaps related to texture perception. Under crowded conditions, the orientation signals in primary visual cortex are pooled before they reach consciousness.},

  doi = {10.1186/2042-6410-3-21},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Because cerebral cortex has a very large number of testosterone receptors, we examined the possible sex differences in color appearance of monochromatic lights across the visible spectrum. There is a history of men and women perceiving color differently. However, all of these studies deal with higher cognitive functions which may be culture-biased. We study basic visual functions, such as color appearance, without reference to any objects. We present here a detailed analysis of sex differences in primary chromatic sensations.

METHODS

We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision, including spatial and temporal resolution, and stereopsis. Based on standard color-screening and anomaloscope data, we excluded all color-deficient observers. Stimuli were equi-luminant monochromatic lights across the spectrum. They were foveally-viewed flashes presented against a dark background. The elicited sensations were measured using magnitude estimation of hue and saturation. When the only permitted hue terms are red (R) yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), alone or in combination, such hue descriptions are language-independent and the hue and saturation values can be used to derive a wide range of color-discrimination functions.

RESULTS

There were relatively small but clear and significant, differences between males and females in the hue sensations elicited by almost the entire spectrum. Generally, males required a slightly longer wavelength to experience the same hue as did females. The spectral loci of the unique hues are not correlated with anomaloscope matches; these matches are directly determined by the spectral sensitivities of L- and M-cones (genes for these cones are on the X-chromosomes). Nor are there correlations between loci of pairs of unique hues (R, Y, G, B). Wavelength-discrimination functions derived from the scaling data show that males have a broader range of poorer discrimination in the middle of the spectrum. The precise values for all the data depend on whether Newtonian or Maxwellian optics were used, but the sex differences were the same for both optical systems.

CONCLUSION

As with our associated paper on spatio-temporal vision, there are marked sex differences in color vision. The color-appearances we measured are determined by inputs from thalamic neurons (LGN) to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from LGN to cortex is guided by the cortex during embryogenesis. We hypothesize that testosterone plays a major role, somehow leading to different connectivities for males and females: color appearance requires a re-combination and re-weighting of neuronal inputs from the LGN to the cortex, which, as we show, depends on the sex of the participant.},

  abstract = {Previously, we and others have shown that attention can enhance visual processing in a spatially specific manner that is retinotopically mapped in the occipital cortex. However, it is difficult to appreciate the functional significance of the spatial pattern of cortical activation just by examining the brain maps. In this study, we visualize the neural representation of the ``spotlight'' of attention using a back-projection of attention-related brain activation onto a diagram of the visual field. In the two main experiments, we examine the topography of attentional activation in the occipital and parietal cortices. In retinotopic areas, attentional enhancement is strongest at the locations of the attended target, but also spreads to nearby locations and even weakly to restricted locations in the opposite visual field. The dispersion of attentional effects around an attended site increases with the eccentricity of the target in a manner that roughly corresponds to a constant area of spread within the cortex. When averaged across multiple observers, these patterns appear consistent with a gradient model of spatial attention. However, individual observers exhibit complex variations that are unique but reproducible. Overall, these results suggest that the topography of visual attention for each individual is composed of a common theme plus a personal variation that may reflect their own unique ``attentional style.''},

Furthermore, mounting evidence implicates the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex in the production of fear responses. Both IL and PL integrate inputs from the amygdala, as well as other structures to gate the expression of fear via projections to inhibitory or excitatory circuits within the amygdala. We suggest that dual control of the amygdala by separate prefrontal modules increases the flexibility of an organism's response to danger cues.},

In February 2010, Eisenegger et al. reported increased fair bargaining behaviour after administration of testosterone in an ultimatum game1. However, unfair offers in the ultimatum game typically are rejected; thus, not only the motives for social cooperation but also the threat of financial punishment may have accounted for these effects. Here, using the public goods game (PGG), we unambiguously show increased social cooperation after testosterone administration, but only among subjects with low levels of prenatal testosterone (measured by the right hand's second-to-fourth-digit ratio (2D:4D)). This finding establishes positive effects of testosterone on social cooperation, with prenatal hormonal priming providing for important individual variability.},

  abstract = {In order to explain the cognitive and cerebral mechanisms responsible for the visuospatial peak in autism, and to document its specificity to this condition, a group of eight high-functioning individuals with autism and a visuospatial peak (HFA-P) performed a modified block-design task (BDT; subtest from Wechsler scales) at various levels of perceptual cohesiveness, as well as tasks tapping visuomotor speed, global perception, visual memory, visual search and speed of visual encoding. Their performance was compared with that of 8 autistics without a visuospatial peak (HFA-NP), 10 typically developing individuals (TD) and 8 gifted comparison participants with a visuospatial peak (TD-P). Both HFA-P and HFA-NP groups presented with diminished detrimental influence of increasing perceptual coherence compared with their BDT-matched comparison groups. Neither autistic group displayed a deficit in construction of global representations. The HFA-P group showed no differences in performance level or profile in comparison with the gifted BDT-matched [i.e. higher full-scale IQ (FSIQ)] group, apart from locally oriented perception. Diminished detrimental influence of perceptual coherence on BDT performance is both sensitive and specific to autism, and superior low-level processing interacts with locally oriented bias to produce outstanding BDT performance in a subgroup of autistic individuals. Locally oriented processing, enhanced performance in multiple tasks relying on detection of simple visual material and enhanced discrimination of first-order gratings converge towards an enhanced functioning and role of the primary visual cortex (V1) in autism. In contrast, superior or typical performance of autistics in tasks requiring global processing is inconsistent with the global-deficit-driven Weak Central Coherence hypothesis and its neurobiological magnocellular deficit counterpart.},

We show a tight link between the occurrence of perceptual alternations and the spatiotemporal properties of visual attention: Alternations occurred earlier and more frequently at locations where visual attention was summoned by an exogenous cue. We argue that cuing a location where rival images are presented leads to a transient increase in the effective contrast of these rival images. This transient increase in effective contrast increases the probability of an alternation at that location. Furthermore, we suggest that an occipito-fronto-parietal network known to be involved in selective attention and binocular rivalry mediates perceptual alternations by boosting the neural response at attended locations.},

  abstract = {The new DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include sensory disturbances in addition to the well-established language, communication, and social deficits. One sensory disturbance seen in ASD is an impaired ability to integrate multisensory information into a unified percept. This may arise from an underlying impairment in which individuals with ASD have difficulty perceiving the temporal relationship between cross-modal inputs, an important cue for multisensory integration. Such impairments in multisensory processing may cascade into higher-level deficits, impairing day-to-day functioning on tasks, such as speech perception. To investigate multisensory temporal processing deficits in ASD and their links to speech processing, the current study mapped performance on a number of multisensory temporal tasks (with both simple and complex stimuli) onto the ability of individuals with ASD to perceptually bind audiovisual speech signals. High-functioning children with ASD were compared with a group of typically developing children. Performance on the multisensory temporal tasks varied with stimulus complexity for both groups; less precise temporal processing was observed with increasing stimulus complexity. Notably, individuals with ASD showed a speech-specific deficit in multisensory temporal processing. Most importantly, the strength of perceptual binding of audiovisual speech observed in individuals with ASD was strongly related to their low-level multisensory temporal processing abilities. Collectively, the results represent the first to illustrate links between multisensory temporal function and speech processing in ASD, strongly suggesting that deficits in low-level sensory processing may cascade into higher-order domains, such as language and communication.},

  doi = {10.1002/aur.164},
  abstract = {Although autism presents a unique perceptual phenotype defined in part by atypical (often enhanced) analysis of spatial information, few biologically plausible hypotheses have been advanced to explain its neural underpinnings. One plausible explanation is functional but altered lateral connectivity mediating early or local mechanisms selectively responsive to different stimulus attributes, including spatial frequency and contrast. The goal of the present study was first to assess far visual acuity in autism using Landolt-C optotypes defined by different local stimulus attributes. Second, we investigated whether acuity is differentially affected in autism when target optotypes are simultaneously presented with flanking stimuli at different distances. This typical detrimental "crowding effect" of flanking stimuli on target optotype discrimination is attributed to lateral inhibitory interaction of neurons encoding for visual properties of distracters close to the target. Results failed to demonstrate a between-group difference in acuity to Landolt-C optotypes, whether defined by luminance- or texture-contrast. However, the expected crowding effect at one gap-size opening distance was evidenced for the control group only; a small effect was observed for the autism group at two gap-size opening. These results suggest that although far visual acuity is unremarkable in autism, altered local lateral connectivity within early perceptual areas underlying spatial information processing in autism is atypical. Altered local lateral connectivity in autism might originate from an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neural signaling, resulting in changes regarding elementary feature extraction and subsequent downstream visual integration and visuo-spatial analysis. This notion is discussed within the context of characteristic lower- and higher-level perceptual processing in autism.},

  title = {Schizophrenia and Autism as Opposite Tuning-Function Disorders: {{A}} Theory},
  abstract = {Schizophrenia and autism are each associated with a large number of genetic and environmental factors, and no single factor controls either disorder. Yet, each disorder clusters around its characteristic set of behaviors (albeit with individual variations), suggesting that the actions of diverse factors for each disorder may converge to induce similar functional consequences. We propose a framework in which the converging point is the tuning functions of neuronal responses to various stimulus features. Specifically, we hypothesize that schizophrenic and autistic brains have broader- and narrower-than-typical tuning functions, respectively, possibly produced by a decrease and increase of nonlinear gains in neuronal responses (Butler et al., 2005).
To perform daily tasks such as face identification or language comprehension, the brain must learn to map inputs (e.g., retinal images) to outputs (e.g., face identity) by extracting relevant, complex regularities from inputs. Computationally, the brain could approximate input-output mappings by nonlinearly combining neuronal responses along processing hierarchies. Different tasks or mappings entail different underlying regularities that are best learned by neurons with different tuning functions. If typical brains have optimized tuning functions to learn socially important tasks, then suboptimal tuning may impair social learning and produce behavioral deficits. Specifically, narrower-than optimal tuning functions bias a system toward rote memorization of experiences without extracting underlying regularities for generalization, leading to, among other things, rigid behaviors, as in autism (Qian \& Lipkin, 2011). Conversely, broader-than-optimal tuning functions impede memorization of multiple items, as in schizophrenia, because of increased overlapping or interference among responses to different items. Thus, broader tuning functions represent experiences less faithfully and encourage over-interpolation/generalization of actual experiences, which could generate illusory ones. Finally, narrower and broader tuning functions are consistent with lack of imagination in autism and loose association in schizophrenia, respectively.
As a prediction, we simulated orientation tilt aftereffect for a range of tuning width and found that narrow (autism) and broad (schizophrenia) tuning produces aftereffects over correspondingly narrow and broad ranges of differences between adapting and test stimuli. This is consistent with Rokem et al.'s (2011) schizophrenia study. Our theory suggests that drugs affecting tuning in opposite ways might help reduce symptoms of these disorders.},

We examined whether dynamic stimulation that surrounds a rival target influences perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry. We presented a rival target surrounded by dynamic random-dot patterns to both eyes, and measured dominance durations for each eye's rival target. We found that rival target dominance durations were longer when surrounds were dynamic than when they were static or absent. Additionally, prolonged dominance durations were more apparent when the dynamic surround was alternately presented between the two eyes than when it was presented simultaneously to both eyes. These results indicate that dynamic stimulation that surrounds a rival target plays a role in maintaining the current perceptual state, and causes less perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry. Our findings suggest that dynamic signals on the retina may suppress rivalry, and thus provide useful information for stabilizing perceptions in daily life.},

We show that cumulative history\textemdash{}an integral of past perceptual states, weighted toward the most recent states\textemdash{}significantly and consistently correlates with future dominance durations: the larger the cumulative history measure, the shorter are future dominance times, revealing a robust effect of neural adaptation. The characteristic time scale of cumulative history, which may be computed by Monte Carlo methods, correlates with average dominance durations, as expected for a measure of neural adaptation. When the cumulative histories of two competing percepts are balanced, perceptual reversals take longer and their outcome becomes random, demonstrating that perceptual reversals are fluctuation-driven in the absence of adaptational bias. Our findings quantify the role of neural adaptation in multistable perception, which accounts for approximately 10\% of the variability of reversal timing.},

Others have reported that TAE is exclusively retinotopic (eye centred): It occurs only when adapter and tester are presented at the same retinal location, even when this corresponds to different display locations.

The psychophysical properties of binocular rivalry have been well described, but newer imaging and electrophysiological techniques have not resolved the issue of where in the brain rivalry occurs. The most recent evidence supports a view of rivalry as a series of processes, each of which is implemented by neural mechanisms at different levels of the visual hierarchy. Although unanswered questions remain, this view of rivalry might allow us to resolve some of the controversies and apparent contradictions that have emerged from its study.},

  abstract = {The responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by stimuli presented in the region surrounding the receptive field. There is debate as to whether this surround suppression is due to intracortical inhibition, is inherited from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), or is due to a combination of these factors. The mechanisms involved in surround suppression may differ from those involved in suppression within the receptive field, which is called cross-orientation suppression. To compare surround suppression to cross-orientation suppression, and to help elucidate its underlying mechanisms, we studied its temporal properties in anesthetized and paralyzed cats. We first measured the temporal resolution of suppression. While cat LGN neurons respond vigorously to drift rates up to 30 Hz, most cat V1 neurons stop responding above 10-15 Hz. If suppression originated in cortical responses, therefore, it should disappear above such drift rates. In a majority of cells, surround suppression decreased substantially when surround drift rate was above approximately 15 Hz, but some neurons demonstrated suppression with surround drift rates as high as 21 Hz. We then measured the susceptibility of suppression to contrast adaptation. Contrast adaptation reduces responses of cortical neurons much more than those of LGN neurons. If suppression originated in cortical responses, therefore, it should be reduced by adaptation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that prolonged exposure to the surround stimulus decreased the strength of surround suppression. The results of both experiments differ markedly from those previously obtained in a study of cross-orientation suppression, whose temporal properties were found to resemble those of LGN neurons. Our results provide further evidence that these two forms of suppression are due to different mechanisms. Surround suppression can be explained by a mixture of thalamic and cortical influences. It could also arise entirely from intracortical inhibition, but only if inhibitory neurons respond to somewhat higher drift rates than most cortical cells.},

Such changes have been suggested to be limited to higher order association areas and to spare primary sensory areas. In addition, evidence from gene-expression studies have suggested that there may be an attenuation of cortical differentiation in autism spectrum disorders. The present study specifically assessed the minicolumns of cells that span the depth of the cortex in a larger sample of autism spectrum disorder cases than have been studied previously, and across a broad age range. The cortical regions to be investigated were carefully chosen to enable hypotheses about cortical differentiation and the vulnerability of association cortex to be tested. Measures of the minicolumnar arrangement of the cortex (minicolumn width, spacing and width of the associated axon bundles) were made in four regions of cortex (primary auditory cortex, auditory association cortex, orbital frontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe) for 28 subjects with autism spectrum disorder and 25 typically developing control subjects. The present study found wider minicolumns in autism spectrum disorder [F(1,28) = 8.098, P = 0.008], which was particularly pronounced at younger ages, providing evidence for an altered developmental trajectory at the microstructural level. In addition, altered minicolumn width was not restricted to higher order association areas, but was also seen in the primary sensory region investigated. Finally, this study found evidence that cortical regional differentiation was still present in autism spectrum disorder [F(3,39) = 5.486, P = 0.003], although attenuated compared to typically developing subjects [F(3,45) = 18.615, P $<$ 0.001]. It is suggested that wider spacing of the minicolumns may relate to the enhanced discrimination seen in some individuals with autism spectrum disorders.},

  abstract = {Peripheral vision is characterized by reduced spatial resolution and inhibitory spatial interactions that extend over long distances. This work had three goals. (1) We considered whether the extensive crowding in peripheral vision is a consequence of a shift in the spatial scale of analysis. To test this, using a large range of target sizes and spatial frequencies, we measured the extent of crowding for targets that were limited in their spatial frequency content. (2) We considered whether crowding in peripheral vision can be explained on the basis of contrast masking by remote flanks. To test this hypothesis, we measured and compared crowding in a direction-identification experiment with masking by remote flanks in a detection experiment. In each of the experiments, our targets and flanks were composed of Gabor features, thus allowing us to control the feature contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation. (3) We examined the relationship between the suppressive and facilitatory interactions in peripheral contrast detection and crowding. Our results show that unlike the normal fovea (Levi, Klein, \& Hariharan, 2002), peripheral crowding is not scale invariant nor is it attributable to simple contrast masking. Rather, our results suggest that inhibitory spatial interactions in peripheral crowding extend over larger distances than in the fovea for targets of the same size. In peripheral vision, the critical distance for crowding is approximately 0.1 times the target eccentricity. Observers can easily detect the features that compose our targets (Gabor patches) under conditions where crowding is strong. Thus, we speculate that peripheral crowding occurs because the target and flanks are combined or pooled at a second stage, following the stage of feature extraction. In peripheral vision, this pooling takes place over a large distance.},

  volume = {70},

  abstract = {1. The activity of single neurons was recorded in Macaca mulatta monkeys while they performed tasks requiring them to select a cued stimulus from an array of three to eight stimuli and report the orientation of that stimulus. Stimuli were presented in a circular array centered on the fixation target and scaled to place a single stimulus element within the receptive field of the neuron under study. The timing of the cuing event permitted the directing of visual attention to the spatial location of the correct stimulus before its presentation. 2. The effects of focal attention were examined in cortical visual areas V1, V2, and V4, where a total of 672 neurons were isolated with complete studies obtained for 94 V1, 74 V2, and 74 V4 neurons with receptive-field center eccentricities in the range 1.8-8 degrees. Under certain conditions, directed focal attention results in changes in the response of V1, V2, and V4 neurons to otherwise identical stimuli at spatially specific locations. 3. More than one-third of the neurons in each area displayed differential sensitivity when attention was directed toward versus away from the spatial location of the receptive field just before and during stimulus presentation. Both relative increases and decreases in neural activity were observed in association with attention directed at receptive-field stimuli. 4. The presence of multiple competing stimuli in the visual field was a major factor determining the presence or absence of differential sensitivity. About two-thirds of the neurons that were differentially sensitive to the attending condition in the presence of competing stimuli were not differentially sensitive when single stimuli were presented in control studies. For V1 and V2 neurons the presence of only a few (3-4) competing stimuli was sufficient for a majority of the neurons studied; a majority of the V4 neurons required six to eight stimuli in the array before significant differences between attending conditions occurred. 5. For V1 and V2 neurons the neuronal sensitivity differences between attending conditions were observed primarily at or near the peak of the orientation tuning sensitivity for each neuron; the differences were evident over a broader range of orientations in V4 neurons. 6. In conclusion, neural correlates of focal attentive processes can be observed in visual cortical processing in areas V1 and V2 as well as area V4 under conditions that require stimulus feature analysis and selective spatial processing within a field of competing stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Computational theories that relate neural circuits with specific quantifiable behavioral and physiological phenomena, therefore, serve as extremely useful tools for elucidating the neuropathological mechanisms that underlie different disorders. The visual system is particularly well suited for characterizing differences in neural computations; computational theories of vision are well established, and empirical protocols for measuring the parameters of those theories are well developed. In this article, we examine how psychophysical and neuroimaging measurements from human subjects are being used to test hypotheses about abnormal neural computations in autism, with an emphasis on hypotheses regarding potential excitation/inhibition imbalances. We discuss the complexity of relating specific computational abnormalities to particular underlying mechanisms given the diversity of neural circuits that can generate the same computation, and we discuss areas of research in which computational theories need to be further developed to provide useful frameworks for interpreting existing results. A final emphasis is placed on the need to extend existing ideas into developmental frameworks that take into account the dramatic developmental changes in neurophysiology (e.g., changes in excitation/inhibition balance) that take place during the first years of life, when autism initially emerges.},

  abstract = {In autism, physiological indices of selective attention have been shown to be abnormal even in situations where behaviour is intact. This divergence between behaviour and physiology suggests the action of some compensatory process of attention, one which may hold clues to the aetiology of autism's characteristic cognitive phenotype. Six subjects with autism spectrum disorders and six normal control subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a bilateral visual spatial attention task. In normal subjects, the task evoked activation in a network of cortical regions including the superior parietal lobe (P$<$0.001), left middle temporal gyrus (P=0.002), left inferior (P$<$0.001) and middle (P$<$0.02) frontal gyri, and medial frontal gyrus (P$<$0.02). Autistic subjects, in contrast, showed activation in the bilateral ventral occipital cortex (P$<$0.03) and striate cortex (P$<$0.05). Within the task condition, a region-of-interest comparison of attend-left versus attend-right conditions indicated that modulation of activation in the autistic brain as a function of the lateral focus of spatial attention was abnormally decreased in the left ventral occipital cortex (P$<$0.03), abnormally increased in the left intraparietal sulcus (P$<$0.01), and abnormally variable in the superior parietal lobe (P$<$0.03). These results are discussed in terms of a model of autism in which a pervasive defect of neural and synaptic development produces over-connected neural systems prone to noise and crosstalk, resulting in hyper-arousal and reduced selectivity. These low-level attentional traits may be the developmental basis for higher-order cognitive styles such as weak central coherence.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify the crowding effect with eccentric stimuli and to determine the relative contribution of neural interaction and attention to crowding in central and eccentric vision. METHODS: Monocular visual acuity was measured with computer-generated tumbling E and Landolt C targets presented centrally or at 2 degrees in the right visual field. Crowding distractors were designed to cause increasing contour interaction or increasing need for focused attention. A four-alternative forced-choice method of constant stimuli was used. In experiment 2 the distance between the target and the distractors was varied. RESULTS: Data are presented in terms of normalized visual acuity. Crowding in central vision was minimal, mainly caused by contour interaction, and did not occur with distractors more than four stroke widths distant. Crowding in eccentric vision was far greater in magnitude and extent (occurring for distractors as far as 16 stroke widths distant) and was caused by contour interaction and attentional factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that eccentric vision differs quantitatively and qualitatively from central vision. The extent of contour interaction effects are consistent with the proposed size of cortical processing zones. The results are discussed with reference to current theories of preattentive and attentive tasks and with reference to subjects with low vision due to central scotoma who use an eccentric retinal locus for fixation.},

A zoom-out attentional dysfunction might be partially responsible for this perceptual integration deficit in ASD. In the present study, the efficiency of attentional focusing mechanisms was investigated in children affected by ASD. We measured response latencies to a visual target onset displayed at three eccentricities from the fixation. Attentional resources were focused (zoom-in) or distributed (zoom-out) in the visual field presenting a small (containing only the nearest target eccentricity) or large (containing also the farthest target eccentricity) cue, 100 or 800~msec, before the target onset. Typically developing children, at the short cue-target interval, showed a gradient effect (i.e., latencies are slower at the farthest eccentricity) in the small focusing cue, but not in the large focusing cue condition. These results indicate an efficient zoom-in and zoom-out attentional mechanism. In contrast, children with ASD showed a gradient effect also in the large focusing cue condition, suggesting a specific zoom-out attentional impairment.

  abstract = {Top-down control is critical to select goal-directed actions in changeable environments, particularly when several options compete for selection. This control system is thought to involve a mechanism that suppresses activation of unwanted response representations. We tested this hypothesis, in humans, by measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a left finger muscle during motor preparation in an adapted Eriksen flanker task. Subjects reported, by a left or right button-press, the orientation of a left- or right-facing central arrow, flanked by two distractor arrows on each side. Central and peripheral arrows either pointed in the same (congruent trial) or in the opposite direction (incongruent trial). Top-down control was manipulated by changing the probability of congruent and incongruent trials in a given block. In the ``mostly incongruent'' (MI) blocks, 80\% of trials were incongruent, producing a context in which subjects strongly anticipated that they would have to face conflict. In the ``mostly congruent'' (MC) blocks, 80\% of trials were congruent and thus subjects barely anticipated conflict in that context. Thus, we assume that top-down control was stronger in the MI than in the MC condition. Accordingly, subjects displayed a lower error rate and shorter reaction times for the incongruent trials in the MI context than for similar trials in the MC context. More interestingly, we found that top-down control specifically reduced activation of the incompatible motor representation during response selection under high conflict. That is, when the central arrow specified a right hand response, left (non-selected) MEPs became smaller in the MI than in the MC condition, but only for incongruent trials, and this measure was positively correlated with performance. In contrast, MEPs elicited in the non-selected hand during congruent trials, or during all trials in which the left hand was selected, tended to increase more after the imperative signal in the MI than the MC condition. Another important observation was that, overall, MEPs were already strongly suppressed at the onset of the imperative signal and that this effect was particularly pronounced in the MI context. Hence, suppression of motor excitability seems to be a key component of conflict resolution.},

  issn = {2168-6238},
  doi = {10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0101},
  abstract = {Importance: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit severe difficulties in social interaction, motor coordination, behavioral flexibility, and atypical sensory processing, with considerable interindividual variability. This heterogeneous set of symptoms recently led to investigating the presence of abnormalities in the interaction across large-scale brain networks. To date, studies have focused either on constrained sets of brain regions or whole-brain analysis, rather than focusing on the interaction between brain networks.
Objectives: To compare the intrinsic functional connectivity between brain networks in a large sample of individuals with ASD and typically developing control subjects and to estimate to what extent group differences would predict autistic traits and reflect different developmental trajectories.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We studied 166 male individuals (mean age, 17.6 years; age range, 7-50 years) diagnosed as having DSM-IV-TR autism or Asperger syndrome and 193 typical developing male individuals (mean age, 16.9 years; age range, 6.5-39.4 years) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were matched for age, IQ, head motion, and eye status (open or closed) in the MRI scanner. We analyzed data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), an aggregated MRI data set from 17 centers, made public in August 2012.
Main Outcomes and Measures: We estimated correlations between time courses of brain networks extracted using a data-driven method (independent component analysis). Subsequently, we associated estimates of interaction strength between networks with age and autistic traits indexed by the Social Responsiveness Scale.
Results: Relative to typically developing control participants, individuals with ASD showed increased functional connectivity between primary sensory networks and subcortical networks (thalamus and basal ganglia) (all t\,$\geq$\,3.13, P\,$<$\,.001 corrected). The strength of such connections was associated with the severity of autistic traits in the ASD group (all r\,$\geq$\,0.21, P\,$<$\,.0067 corrected). In addition, subcortico-cortical interaction decreased with age in the entire sample (all r\,$\leq$\,-0.09, P\,$<$\,.012 corrected), although this association was significant only in typically developing participants (all r\,$\leq$\,-0.13, P\,$<$\,.009 corrected).
Conclusions and Relevance: Our results showing ASD-related impairment in the interaction between primary sensory cortices and subcortical regions suggest that the sensory processes they subserve abnormally influence brain information processing in individuals with ASD. This might contribute to the occurrence of hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity and of difficulties in top-down regulation of behavior.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of paradigms have shown that autistic individuals present with superior performance on visual tasks. Here, the impact of task constraints on visual hierarchical processing in autism was investigated. By employing free- and forced-choice procedures, global and local processing of Navon-type hierarchical numerals was examined in 15 autistic persons (13 males, 2 females) and a comparison group. In the free-choice condition, autistics chose global and local targets randomly, though they were faster responding to local than to global targets, regardless of visual angle and exposure duration. In contrast, the comparison group exhibited a global advantage in naming time, which was evident only for shorter exposures, as well as effects of visual angle. In the forced-choice condition, autistics presented with a more important local-to-global interference than global-to-local interference, whereas the comparison group exhibited global advantage and bidirectional interference. Overall, the autistic participants presented with atypical local-to-global interference and local advantage in incongruent conditions (where global and local targets differ), in naming time as well as accuracy. The relative insensitivity of local bias to task constraints in autistics, in comparison to nonautistic participants, indicates that local bias, with local-to-global interference, is a key and characteristic feature of autistic visual cognition and a strong candidate for the "endophenotype" of autism.},

Earlier work has shown that the predominance of a binocular rival target is enhanced if that target fits well\textemdash{}via common color, orientation, or motion\textemdash{}with its surrounding objects. In the present experiments, the global context outside of the region of rivalry was changed during rivalry, to learn whether contextual information alters the ability to detect changes in a suppressed target itself. Results indicate that context will maintain the dominance of a rival target, but will not encourage a suppressed target to escape from suppression. Evidently, the fate of the suppressed stimulus is determined by neural events distinct from those responsible for global organization during dominance. To reconcile diverse findings concerning rivalry, it may be important to distinguish between processes responsible for selection of one eye's input for dominance from processes responsible for the implementation and maintenance of suppression.},

When such ambiguous configurations are presented intermittently, observers tend to see the same perceptual state on successive trials. The outcome of each trial apparently serves to "prime" the outcome of the following. We sought to determine how long the influence of a past trial persists by using ambiguous motion quartets as stimuli. We found large, significant effects of all four most recent trials, but the results were not consistent with any priming model. The results could be explained instead as perceptual completion of two kinds of temporal patterns, repeating and alternating. We conclude that the visual system does not passively remember perceptual state: it analyzes recent perceptual history and attempts to predict what will come next. These predictions can alter what is seen.},

Devaluation of the outcome of the drug seeking link (i.e., the drug taking link of the chained schedule) by extinction significantly decreased drug seeking indicating that behavior is goal-directed rather than habitual. With, however, more prolonged drug experience, animals transitioned to habitual cocaine seeking. Thus, in these animals, cocaine seeking was insensitive to outcome devaluation. Moreover, when the dorsolateral striatum, an area implicated in habit learning, was transiently inactivated, outcome devaluation was effective in decreasing drug seeking indicating that responding was no longer habitual but had reverted to control by the goal-directed system. These studies provide direct evidence that cocaine seeking becomes habitual with prolonged drug experience and describe a rodent model with which to study the neural mechanisms underlying the transition from goal-directed to habitual drug seeking.},

We introduced one of these mutations into mice: the Arg451$\rightarrow$Cys451 (R451C) substitution in neuroligin-3. R451C mutant mice showed impaired social interactions but enhanced spatial learning abilities. Unexpectedly, these behavioral changes were accompanied by an increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission with no apparent effect on excitatory synapses. Deletion of neuroligin-3, in contrast, did not cause such changes, indicating that the R451C substitution represents a gain-of-function mutation. These data suggest that increased inhibitory synaptic transmission may contribute to human ASDs and that the R451C knockin mice may be a useful model for studying autism-related behaviors.},

Uncertainty in various forms plagues our interactions with the environment. In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain's implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.},

To test these proposals, we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) after local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABAA antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300\%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model in which GABAA inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABAA inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

  abstract = {Low-contrast visual contour fragments are easier to detect when presented in the context of nearby collinear contour elements (U. Polat \& D. Sagi, 1993). The spatial and temporal determinants of this collinear facilitation have been studied extensively (J. R. Cass \& B. Spehar, 2005; Y. Tanaka \& D. Sagi, 1998; C. B. Williams \& R. F. Hess, 1998), although considerable debate surrounds the neural mechanisms underlying it. Our study examines this question using a novel stimulus, whereby the flanking "contour" elements are rotated around their own axis. By measuring contrast detection thresholds to a brief foveal target presented at various phases of flanker rotation, we find peak facilitation after flankers have rotated beyond their collinear phase. This optimal facilitative delay increases monotonically as a function of target-flanker separation, yielding estimates of cortical propagation of 0.1 m/s, a value highly consistent with the dynamics of long-range horizontal interactions observed within primary visual cortex (V1). A curious new finding is also observed: Facilitative peaks also occur when the target flash precedes flanker collinearity by 20-80 ms, a range consistent with contrast-dependent cortical onset latencies. Together, these data suggest that collinear facilitation involves two separate mechanisms, each possessing distinct dynamics: (i) slowly propagating horizontal interactions within V1 and (ii) a faster integrative mechanism, possibly driven by synchronous collinear cortical onset.},

Here, we measured both judgment accuracy and confidence in those judgments across multiple probe contrast levels, and we found evidence for high accuracy with reduced awareness during suppression that was not due to probe-induced switches in rivalry dominance. This dissociation points to the existence of blindsight-like behavior in normal observers.},

  abstract = {In a series of three experiments, we used an ambiguous plaid motion stimulus to explore the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of prior stimulus exposures and perceptual states on current awareness. The results showed that prior exposure to a stimulus biased toward one percept led to subsequent suppression of that percept. In contrast, in the absence of stimulus bias, prior perceptual experience can have a facilitative influence. The suppressive effects caused by the prior stimulus were found to transfer to an ambiguous plaid test stimulus rotated 180\textordmasculine{} relative to the adaptation stimulus, but were abolished if (1) the ambiguous test stimulus was only rotated 90\textordmasculine{} relative to the adaptation stimulus or (2) the adaptation stimulus was heavily biased toward the component grating percept. Event-related potential recordings were consistent with the involvement of visual cortical areas and suggested that the influence of recent stimulus exposure may involve recruitment of additional brain processes beyond those responsible for initial stimulus encoding. In contrast, the effects of prior and current perceptual experience appeared to depend on similar brain processes. Although the data presented here focus on vision, the work is discussed within the context of data from a parallel series of experiments in audition.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry occurs when conflicting images are presented in corresponding locations of the two eyes. Perception alternates between the images at a rate that is relatively stable within individuals but that varies widely between individuals. The determinants of this variation are unknown. In addition, slow binocular rivalry has been demonstrated in bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition with high heritability. The present study therefore examined whether there is a genetic contribution to individual variation in binocular rivalry rate. We employed the twin method and studied both monozygotic (MZ) twins (n = 128 pairs) who are genetically identical, and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 220 pairs) who share roughly half their genes. MZ and DZ twin correlations for binocular rivalry rate were 0.51 and 0.19, respectively. The best-fitting genetic model showed 52\% of the variance in binocular rivalry rate was accounted for by additive genetic factors. In contrast, nonshared environmental influences accounted for 18\% of the variance, with the remainder attributed to measurement error. This study therefore demonstrates a substantial genetic contribution to individual variation in binocular rivalry rate. The results support the vigorous pursuit of genetic and molecular studies of binocular rivalry and further characterization of slow binocular rivalry as an endophenotype for bipolar disorder.},

The prelimbic (PL) subregion of mPFC projects to the amygdala, and neurons in PL show fear-related increases in activity. It is unknown, however, whether PL activity is necessary for expression of learned fears, expression of innate fears, or the learning of fear associations. To address this, we used the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin to inactivate PL during fear learning or expression. Inactivation of PL reduced freezing to both a tone and a context that had been previously paired with footshock (learned fear) but had no effect on freezing to a cat (innate fear). Inactivation of PL before conditioning, however, did not prevent the formation of auditory or contextual fear memories. Thus, activity in PL is critical for the expression, but not the acquisition, of learned fears. We suggest that PL integrates information from auditory and contextual inputs and regulates expression of fear memories via projections to the basal nucleus of the amygdala.},

We identify several key controversies that have stimulated important work on these problems. In the case of stereopsis those controversies include position vs. phase encoding of disparity, dependence of disparity limits on spatial scale, role of occlusion in binocular depth and surface perception, and motion in 3D. In the case of binocular rivalry, controversies include eye vs. stimulus rivalry, role of ``top-down'' influences on rivalry dynamics, and the interaction of binocular rivalry and stereopsis. Concerning binocular contrast summation, the essay focuses on two representative models that highlight the evolving complexity in this field of study.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs. However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology. Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits. These findings demonstrate new roles for Tsc1 in PC function and define a molecular basis for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive disorders such as autism.},

  abstract = {Background
Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience atypical visual perception, yet the etiology of this remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of visual perception in individuals with and without ASD by carrying out a detailed analysis of the dynamic brain processes elicited by perception of a simple visual stimulus.
Methods
We investigated perception in 20 individuals with ASD and 20 control subjects with electroencephalography (EEG). Visual evoked potentials elicited by Gabor patches of varying spatial frequency and stimulus-induced changes in $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-frequency bands of independent components were compared in those with and without ASD.
Results
By decomposing the EEG data into independent components, we identified several processes that contributed to the average event related potential recorded at the scalp. Differences between the ASD and control groups were found only in some of these processes. Specifically, in those components that were in or near the striate or extrastriate cortex, stimulus spatial frequency exerted a smaller effect on induced increases in $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-band power, and time to peak $\alpha$-band power was reduced, in the participants with ASD. Induced $\alpha$-band power of components that were in or near the cingulate gyrus was increased in the participants with ASD, and the components that were in or near the parietal cortex did not differ between the two groups.
Conclusions
Atypical processing is evident in individuals with ASD during perception of simple visual stimuli. The implications of these data for existing theories of atypical perception in ASD are discussed.},

How peripheral visual field loss (PVFL) affects this process is not well understood. We examine how the location and extent of PVFL affects eye movement behavior in a naturalistic visual search task. Ten patients with PVFL and 13 normally sighted subjects with full visual fields (FVF) completed 30 visual searches monocularly. Subjects located a 4$^\circ$ \texttimes{} 4$^\circ$ target, pseudo-randomly selected within a 26$^\circ$ \texttimes{} 11$^\circ$ natural image. Eye positions were recorded at 50 Hz. Search duration, fixation duration, saccade size, and number of saccades per trial were not significantly different between PVFL and FVF groups (p $>$ 0.1). A $\chi$2 test showed that the distributions of saccade directions for PVFL and FVL subjects were significantly different in 8 out of 10 cases (p $<$ 0.01). Humphrey Visual Field pattern deviations for each subject were compared with the spatial distribution of eye movement directions. There were no significant correlations between saccade directional bias and visual field sensitivity across the 10 patients. Visual search performance was not significantly affected by PVFL. An analysis of eye movement directions revealed patients with PVFL show a biased directional distribution that was not directly related to the locus of vision loss, challenging feed-forward models of eye movement control. Consequently, many patients do not optimally compensate for visual field loss during visual search.},

  abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as a heterogeneous set of social, cognitive, motor, and perceptual symptoms. This system-wide pervasiveness suggests that, rather than narrowly impacting individual systems such as affection or vision, autism may broadly alter neural computation. Here, we propose that alterations in nonlinear, canonical computations occurring throughout the brain may underlie the behavioral characteristics of autism. One such computation, called divisive normalization, balances a neuron's net excitation with inhibition reflecting the overall activity of the neuronal population. Through neural network simulations, we investigate how alterations in divisive normalization may give rise to autism symptomatology. Our findings show that a reduction in the amount of inhibition that occurs through divisive normalization can account for perceptual consequences of autism, consistent with the hypothesis of an increased ratio of neural excitation to inhibition (E/I) in the disorder. These results thus establish a bridge between an E/I imbalance and behavioral data on autism that is currently absent. Interestingly, our findings implicate the context-dependent, neuronal milieu as a key factor in autism symptomatology, with autism reflecting a less ``social'' neuronal population. Through a broader discussion of perceptual data, we further examine how altered divisive normalization may contribute to a wide array of the disorder's behavioral consequences. These analyses show how a computational framework can provide insights into the neural basis of autism and facilitate the generation of falsifiable hypotheses. A computational perspective on autism may help resolve debates within the field and aid in identifying physiological pathways to target in the treatment of the disorder.},

  abstract = {Background
Perturbations to the microscopic level balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition and neuron organization in the cerebral cortex are suggested to underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits. The mechanism linking these perturbations to cognitive behaviors in ASD is unknown. This study strives to bridge this gap by generating clinically testable diagnostic and pharmacological predictions based on the effect of synaptic imbalance and neuron distribution on a computational local circuit model of the cerebral cortex.
Methods
We use a computational microscopic model of the cerebral cortex that incorporates N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid synaptic kinetics. We employ the model circuit during model tasks similar to visually guided and gap oculomotor saccade tasks and interpret qualitative model predictions of saccade hypometria and dysmetria. We consider the effects of varying the excitatory to inhibitory synaptic balance, neuron density, and neuron clustering in this model.
Results
An increase of synaptic excitation over synaptic inhibition results in increased hypometria and dysmetria. Similar effects by either reduced inhibition or increased excitation suggest that a variety of pharmacological compounds can be used for both screening and medical management. On the other hand, any change to the microscopic neuron anatomy that increases the effective maximum distance between excitatory neurons decreases hypometria but has no affect on dysmetria.
Conclusions
Perturbations to a computational model of a local cerebral cortical circuit can account for saccade hypometria and dysmetria reported in ASD studies. This approach may provide a direct link between cerebral cortical function and ASD behaviors.},

  abstract = {Understanding autism's ever-expanding array of behaviors, from sensation to cognition, is a major challenge. We posit that autistic and typically developing brains implement different algorithms that are better suited to learn, represent, and process different tasks; consequently, they develop different interests and behaviors. Computationally, a continuum of algorithms exists, from lookup table (LUT) learning, which aims to store experiences precisely, to interpolation (INT) learning, which focuses on extracting underlying statistical structure (regularities) from experiences. We hypothesize that autistic and typical brains, respectively, are biased toward LUT and INT learning, in low- and high-dimensional feature spaces, possibly because of their narrow and broad tuning functions. The LUT style is good at learning relationships that are local, precise, rigid, and contain little regularity for generalization (e.g., the name\textendash{}number association in a phonebook). However, it is poor at learning relationships that are context dependent, noisy, flexible, and do contain regularities for generalization (e.g., associations between gaze direction and intention, language and meaning, sensory input and interpretation, motor-control signal and movement, and social situation and proper response). The LUT style poorly compresses information, resulting in inefficiency, sensory overload (overwhelm), restricted interests, and resistance to change. It also leads to poor prediction and anticipation, frequent surprises and over-reaction (hyper-sensitivity), impaired attentional selection and switching, concreteness, strong local focus, weak adaptation, and superior and inferior performances on simple and complex tasks. The spectrum nature of autism can be explained by different degrees of LUT learning among different individuals, and in different systems of the same individual. Our theory suggests that therapy should focus on training autistic LUT algorithm to learn regularities.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that visual crowding\textemdash{}the breakdown in recognition that occurs when objects are presented in cluttered scenes\textemdash{}reflects a limit imposed by visual attention. We examined this idea in the context of an orientation averaging task, having subjects judge the mean orientation of a set of oriented signal elements either in isolation, or ``crowded'' by nearby randomly oriented elements. In some conditions, subjects also had to perform an attentionally demanding secondary task. By measuring performance at different levels of signal orientation variability, we show that crowding increases subjects' local uncertainty (about the orientation of individual elements) but that diverting attention reduces their global efficiency (the effective number of elements they can average over). Furthermore, performance with the same stimulus-sequence, presented multiple times, reveals that crowding does not induce more stimulus-independent variability (as would be predicted by some accounts based on attention). We conclude that crowding and attentional load have dissociable perceptual consequences for orientation averaging, suggesting distinct neural mechanisms for both. For the task we examined, attention can modulate the effects of crowding by changing the efficiency with which information is analyzed by the visual system but since crowding changes local uncertainty, not efficiency, crowding does not reflect an attentional limit.},

However, this illusion can be easily dispelled by trying to identify objects in a cluttered environment out of the corner of your eye.

Objects that can be easily identified in isolation seem indistinct and jumbled in clutter. Crowding is thought to reflect inappropriate integration of the target and flankers in peripheral vision,. Here we uncover and explain a paradox in peripheral crowding: under certain conditions increasing the size or number of flanking rings results in a paradoxical decrease in the magnitude of crowding \textendash{} i.e., the bigger or more numerous the flanks, the smaller the crowding. These surprising results are predicted by a model in which crowding is determined by the centroids of $\approx$ 4 \textendash{} 8 independent features within $\approx$ 0.5 times the target eccentricity. These features are then integrated into a texture beyond the stage of feature analysis. We speculate that this process may contribute to the illusion of high resolution across the field of vision.},

  abstract = {Consistent with the dorsal stream hypothesis, difficulties processing dynamic information have previously been reported in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, no research has systematically compared motion processing abilities for slow and fast speeds. Here, we measured speed discrimination thresholds and motion coherence thresholds in slow (1.5 deg/sec) and fast (6 deg/sec) speed conditions in children with an ASC aged 7 to 14 years, and age- and ability-matched typically developing children. Unexpectedly, children with ASC were as sensitive as typically developing children to differences in speed at both slow and fast reference speeds. Yet, elevated motion coherence thresholds were found in children with ASC, but in the slow stimulus speed condition only. Rather than having pervasive difficulties in motion processing, as predicted by the dorsal stream hypothesis, these results suggest that children with ASC have a selective difficulty in extracting coherent motion information specifically at slow speeds. Understanding the effects of stimulus parameters such as stimulus speed will be important for resolving discrepancies between previous studies examining motion coherence thresholds in ASC and also for refining theoretical models of altered autistic perception.

  abstract = {Structural and functional underconnectivity have been reported for multiple brain regions, functional systems, and white matter tracts in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although recent developments in complex network analysis have established that the brain is a modular network exhibiting small-world properties, network level organization has not been carefully examined in ASD. Here we used resting-state functional MRI (n = 42 ASD, n = 37 typically developing; TD) to show that children and adolescents with ASD display reduced short and long-range connectivity within functional systems (i.e., reduced functional integration) and stronger connectivity between functional systems (i.e., reduced functional segregation), particularly in default and higher-order visual regions. Using graph theoretical methods, we show that pairwise group differences in functional connectivity are reflected in network level reductions in modularity and clustering (local efficiency), but shorter characteristic path lengths (higher global efficiency). Structural networks, generated from diffusion tensor MRI derived fiber tracts (n = 51 ASD, n = 43 TD), displayed lower levels of white matter integrity yet higher numbers of fibers. TD and ASD individuals exhibited similar levels of correlation between raw measures of structural and functional connectivity (n = 35 ASD, n = 35 TD). However, a principal component analysis combining structural and functional network properties revealed that the balance of local and global efficiency between structural and functional networks was reduced in ASD, positively correlated with age, and inversely correlated with ASD symptom severity. Overall, our findings suggest that modeling the brain as a complex network will be highly informative in unraveling the biological basis of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

We obviated this possibility using stimuli that observers could not perceive, but that nevertheless, through orientation contrast between foreground and background regions, attracted attention to improve a localized visual discrimination. When orientation contrast increased, so did the degree of attraction, and two physiological measures: the amplitude of the earliest (C1) component of the ERP, which is associated with primary visual cortex, and fMRI BOLD signals in areas V1-V4 (but not the intraparietal sulcus). Significantly, across observers, the degree of attraction correlated with the C1 amplitude and just the V1 BOLD signal. These findings strongly support the proposal that a bottom-up saliency map is created in V1, challenging the dominant view that the saliency map is generated in the parietal cortex.},

We studied attentional selection, using perceptually ambiguous stimuli in a novel multisensory paradigm that combined competing auditory and competing visual stimuli. We demonstrate that the ability to select, and attentively hold, one of the competing alternatives in either sensory modality is greatly enhanced when there is a matching cross-modal stimulus. Intriguingly, this multimodal enhancement of attentional selection seems to require a conscious act of attention, as passively experiencing the multisensory stimuli did not enhance control over the stimulus. We also demonstrate that congruent auditory or tactile information, and combined auditory\textendash{}tactile information, aids attentional control over competing visual stimuli and visa versa. Our data suggest a functional role for recently found neurons that combine voluntarily initiated attentional functions across sensory modalities. We argue that these units provide a mechanism for structuring multisensory inputs that are then used to selectively modulate early (unimodal) cortical processing, boosting the gain of task-relevant features for willful control over perceptual awareness.},

We investigated the expression of four GABAA receptor subunits and observed significant reductions in GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, and GABRB3 in parietal cortex (Brodmann's Area 40 (BA40)), while GABRA1 and GABRB3 were significantly altered in cerebellum, and GABRA1 was significantly altered in superior frontal cortex (BA9). The presence of seizure disorder did not have a significant impact on GABAA receptor subunit expression in the three brain areas.

  abstract = {Crowding occurs when nearby flankers jumble the appearance of a target object, making it hard to identify. Crowding is feature integration over an inappropriately large region. What determines the size of that region? According to bottom-up proposals, the size is that of an anatomically determined isolation field. According to top-down proposals, the size is that of the spotlight of attention. Intriligator and Cavanagh (2001) proposed the latter, but we show that their conclusion rests on an implausible assumption. Here we investigate the role of attention in crowding using the change blindness paradigm. We measure capacity for widely and narrowly spaced letters during a change detection task, both with and without an interstimulus cue. We find that standard crowding manipulations\textemdash{}reducing spacing and adding flankers\textemdash{}severely impair uncued change detection but have no effect on cued change detection. Because crowded letters look less familiar, we must use longer internal descriptions (less compact representations) to remember them. Thus, fewer fit into working memory. The memory limit does not apply to the cued condition because the observer need remember only the cued letter. Cued performance escapes the effects of crowding, as predicted by a top-down account. However, our most parsimonious account of the results is bottom-up: Cued change detection is so easy that the observer can tolerate feature degradation and letter distortion, making the observer immune to crowding. The change detection task enhances the classic partial report paradigm by making the test easier (same/different instead of identifying one of many possible targets), which increases its sensitivity, so it can reveal degraded memory traces.},

  abstract = {Autistics often exhibit enhanced perceptual abilities when engaged in visual search, visual discrimination, and embedded figure detection. In similar fashion, while performing a range of perceptual or cognitive tasks, autistics display stronger physiological engagement of the visual system than do non-autistics. To account for these findings, the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning Model proposes that enhanced autistic performance in basic perceptual tasks results from stronger engagement of sensory processing mechanisms, a situation that may facilitate an atypically prominent role for perceptual mechanisms in supporting cognition. Using quantitative meta-analysis of published functional imaging studies from which Activation Likelihood Estimation maps were computed, we asked whether autism is associated with enhanced task-related activity for a broad range of visual tasks. To determine whether atypical engagement of visual processing is a general or domain-specific phenomenon, we examined three different visual processing domains: faces, objects, and words. Overall, we observed more activity in autistics compared to non-autistics in temporal, occipital, and parietal regions. In contrast, autistics exhibited less activity in frontal cortex. The spatial distribution of the observed differential between-group patterns varied across processing domains. Autism may be characterized by enhanced functional resource allocation in regions associated with visual processing and expertise. Atypical adult organizational patterns may reflect underlying differences in developmental neural plasticity that can result in aspects of the autistic phenotype, including enhanced visual skills, atypical face processing, and hyperlexia.

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been characterized by atypical socio-communicative behavior, sensorimotor impairment and abnormal neurodevelopmental trajectories. DTI has been used to determine the presence and nature of abnormality in white matter integrity that may contribute to the behavioral phenomena that characterize ASD. Although atypical patterns of sensory responding in ASD are well documented in the behavioral literature, much less is known about the neural networks associated with aberrant sensory processing. To address the roles of basic sensory, sensory association and early attentional processes in sensory responsiveness in ASD, our investigation focused on five white matter fiber tracts known to be involved in these various stages of sensory processing: superior corona radiata, centrum semiovale, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and splenium. We acquired high angular resolution diffusion images from 32 children with ASD and 26 typically developing children between the ages of 5 and 8. We also administered sensory assessments to examine brain-behavior relationships between white matter integrity and sensory variables. Our findings suggest a modulatory role of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and splenium in atypical sensorimotor and early attention processes in ASD. Increased tactile defensiveness was found to be related to reduced fractional anisotropy in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which may reflect an aberrant connection between limbic structures in the temporal lobe and the inferior parietal cortex. Our findings also corroborate the modulatory role of the splenium in attentional orienting, but suggest the possibility of a more diffuse or separable network for social orienting in ASD. Future investigation should consider the use of whole brain analyses for a more robust assessment of white matter microstructure.},

Despite its relevance to theories of altered cortical connectivity, synaptic spine expression has not been systematically explored in ASD. Here we examine dendritic spines on Golgi-impregnated cortical pyramidal cells in the cortex of ASD subjects and age-matched control cases. Pyramidal cells were studied within both the superficial and deep cortical layers of frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe regions. Relative to controls, spine densities were greater in ASD subjects. In analyses restricted to the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, greater spine densities were found predominantly within layer II of each cortical location and within layer V of the temporal lobe. High spine densities were associated with decreased brain weights and were most commonly found in ASD subjects with lower levels of cognitive functioning. Greater spine densities in ASD subjects provide structural support for recent suggestions of connectional changes within the cerebral cortex that may result in altered cortical computations.},

  title = {{{GABA}}({{A}}) {{Receptors In ASD}} - {{A Multicenter Positron Emission Tomography}} ({{PET}}) {{Study}}},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Deficits in GABA neurotransmission, in 

particular GABA(A) receptor expression, might be a key 

part of the pathophysiology of ASD. We recently (Mendez 

et al. 2013) reported reduced GABA(A) receptor alpha5 

subtype binding in ASD adults in a pilot study. However, 

this requires replication.

Therefore, in this multicenter study, part of the EU-AIMS 

Consortium, we ran two linked experiments. At the 

Karolinska Institute, we used the PET tracer 

[11C]flumazenil to measure total GABA(A) receptors. At 

King's College London, we used the more selective 

[11C]Ro154513 to selectively quantify GABA(A) alpha1 

and alpha5 subtypes using spectral decomposition (Myers 

et al. 2012).

METHODS: In the [11C]flumazenil experiment, 15 adults 

with ASD were compared to 15 healthy controls matched 

for age, sex, and IQ. In the [11C]Ro154513 experiment, 12 

male adults with ASD were compared to 16 controls 

matched for age, sex, and IQ.

Inclusion criteria: age 18-50; medically fit; not on 

psychotropic medication; IQ $>$ 70; no history of epilepsy. 

All ASD volunteers had been clinically diagnosed by using 

DSM-V criteria and verified by ADOS and, where possible, 

ADI.

RESULTS: Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no 

evidence of differences in [11C]flumazenil binding potential 

in any brain region (all p $>$ 0.22). Using [11C]Ro154513, 

we likewise found no significant differences in whole-brain 

GABA(A) alpha1 (p=0.44) or alpha5 (p=0.49) receptors in 

adults with ASD, nor were there significant regional 

differences in any brain area.

CONCLUSIONS: In the largest PET study of GABA(A) in

ASD to date, we did not find GABA(A) receptor density 

abnormalities. However reductions may exist in children 

(Mori et al. 2011) or in ASD subgroups such as ASD with 

intellectual disability. Also, we cannot rule out differences in

GABA(A) receptor function.},

  abstract = {Crowding\textemdash{}the deleterious influence of clutter on object recognition\textemdash{}disrupts the identification of visual features as diverse as orientation, motion, and color. It is unclear whether this occurs via independent feature-specific crowding processes (preceding the feature binding process) or via a singular (late) mechanism tuned for combined features. To examine the relationship between feature binding and crowding, we measured interactions between the crowding of relative position and orientation. Stimuli were a target cross and two flanker crosses (each composed of two near-orthogonal lines), 15 degrees in the periphery. Observers judged either the orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) of the near-horizontal target line, its position (up/down relative to the stimulus center), or both. For single-feature judgments, crowding affected position and orientation similarly: thresholds were elevated and responses biased in a manner suggesting that the target appeared more like the flankers. These effects were tuned for orientation, with near-orthogonal elements producing little crowding. This tuning allowed us to separate the predictions of independent (feature specific) and combined (singular) models: for an independent model, reduced crowding for one feature has no effect on crowding for other features, whereas a combined process affects either all features or none. When observers made conjoint judgments, a reduction of orientation crowding (by increasing target\textendash{}flanker orientation differences) increased the rate of correct responses for both position and orientation, as predicted by our combined model. In contrast, our independent model incorrectly predicted a high rate of position errors, since the probability of positional crowding would be unaffected by changes in orientation. Thus, at least for these features, crowding is a singular process that affects bound position and orientation values in an all-or-none fashion.},

Numerous recent imaging studies have attempted to unveil neural substrates underlying multistable perception. However, these studies had a conceptual constraint: access to observers' perceptual state relied on their introspection and active report. Here, we investigated to what extent neural correlates of binocular rivalry in healthy humans are confounded by this subjective measure and by action. We used the optokinetic nystagmus and pupil size to objectively and continuously map perceptual alternations for binocular-rivalry stimuli. Combining these two measures with fMRI allowed us to assess the neural correlates of binocular rivalry time locked to the perceptual alternations in the absence of active report. When observers were asked to actively report their percept, our objective measures matched the report. In this active condition, objective measures and subjective reporting revealed that occipital, parietal, and frontal areas underlie the processing of binocular rivalry, replicating earlier findings. Furthermore, objective measures provided additional statistical power due to their continuous nature. Importantly, when observers passively experienced rivalry without reporting perceptual alternations, a different picture emerged: differential neural activity in frontal areas was absent, whereas activation in occipital and parietal regions persisted. Our results question the popular view of a driving role of frontal areas in the initiation of perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry. Instead, we conclude that frontal areas are associated with active report and introspection rather than with rivalry per se.},

  abstract = {Prediction may be a fundamental principle of sensory processing: it has been proposed that the brain continuously generates predictions about forthcoming sensory information. However, little is known about how prediction contributes to the selection of a conscious percept from among competing alternatives. Here, we used binocular rivalry to investigate the effects of prediction on perceptual selection. In binocular rivalry, incompatible images presented to the two eyes result in a perceptual alternation between the images, even though the visual stimuli remain constant. If predictive signals influence the competition between neural representations of rivalrous images, this influence should generate a bias in perceptual selection that depends on predictive context. To manipulate predictive context, we developed a novel binocular rivalry paradigm in which rivalrous test images were immediately preceded by a sequence of context images presented identically to the two eyes. One of the test images was consistent with the preceding image sequence (it was the expected next image in the series), and the other was inconsistent (non-predicted). We found that human observers were more likely to perceive the consistent image at the onset of rivalry, suggesting that predictive context biased selection in favor of the predicted percept. This prediction effect was distinct from the effects of adaptation to stimuli presented before the binocular rivalry test. In addition, perceptual reports were speeded for predicted percepts relative to non-predicted percepts. These results suggest that predictive signals related to visual stimulus history exist at neural sites that can bias conscious perception during binocular rivalry. Our paradigm provides a new way to study how prior information and incoming sensory information combine to generate visual percepts.},

  abstract = {To judge the overall direction of a shoal of fish or a crowd of people, observers must integrate motion signals across space and time. The limits on our ability to pool motion have largely been established using the motion coherence paradigm, in which observers report the direction of coherently moving dots amid randomly moving noise dots. Poor performance by autistic individuals on this task has widely been interpreted as evidence of disrupted integrative processes. Critically, however, motion coherence thresholds are not necessarily limited only by pooling. They could also be limited by imprecision in estimating the direction of individual elements or by difficulties segregating signal from noise. Here, 33 children with autism 6\textendash{}13 years of age and 33 age- and ability-matched typical children performed a more robust task reporting mean dot direction both in the presence and the absence of directional variability alongside a standard motion coherence task. Children with autism were just as sensitive to directional differences as typical children when all elements moved in the same direction (no variability). However, remarkably, children with autism were more sensitive to the average direction in the presence of directional variability, providing the first evidence of enhanced motion integration in autism. Despite this improved averaging ability, children with autism performed comparably to typical children in the motion coherence task, suggesting that their motion coherence thresholds may be limited by reduced segregation of signal from noise. Although potentially advantageous under some conditions, increased integration may lead to feelings of ``sensory overload'' in children with autism.},

  abstract = {When the brain is presented with ambiguous visual stimuli supporting two interpretations, perception becomes bistable and alternates over time between one interpretation and the other. This process contains elements of competition (between the rivaling percepts) as well as inhibition, as the percepts are mutually exclusive so that one is always suppressed. This review covers the most widely studied form of bistable perception\textemdash{}binocular rivalry. Suppression in rivalry is covered in detail, including discussion of its general and specific components, its local nature and spatial organization, techniques for quantifying it, and the role of global feedback. The competitive dynamics of rivalry are discussed within the context of the classical `adapting reciprocal inhibition' model of rivalry and recent evidence supporting this model is discussed. This model is contrasted with alternative models based on late competition and with hybrid models. Finally, the role of attention in rivalry is examined and commonalities with other forms of bistable perception are noted.

  abstract = {The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by mask stimuli that do not elicit responses if presented alone. This suppression is widely believed to be mediated by intracortical inhibition. As an alternative, we propose that it can be explained by thalamocortical synaptic depression. This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast. It explains why transient responses to flashed stimuli are nonlinear, whereas spatial summation is primarily linear. These results suggest that the very first synapses into the cortex, and not the cortical network, may account for important response properties of V1 neurons.},

The original suggestion of a core deficit in central processing resulting in failure to extract global form/meaning, has been challenged in three ways. First, it may represent an outcome of superiority in local processing. Second, it may be a processing bias, rather than deficit. Third, weak coherence may occur alongside, rather than explain, deficits in social cognition. A review of over 50 empirical studies of coherence suggests robust findings of local bias in ASD, with mixed findings regarding weak global processing. Local bias appears not to be a mere side-effect of executive dysfunction, and may be independent of theory of mind deficits. Possible computational and neural models are discussed.},

GABA becomes inhibitory by the delayed expression of a chloride exporter, leading to a negative shift in the reversal potential for choride ions. I propose that this mechanism provides a solution to the problem of how to excite developing neurons to promote growth and synapse formation while avoiding the potentially toxic effects of a mismatch between GABA-mediated inhibition and glutamatergic excitation. As key elements of this cascade are activity dependent, the formation of inhibition adds an element of nurture to the construction of cortical networks.},

Here we explore how the two eyes' views are combined to represent a scene that contains monocular regions, partially hidden behind a foreground occluding ``fence.'' We measured performance in a density/numerosity discrimination task for scenes containing differing amounts of binocular and monocular information. We find that information from a number of separate monocular regions can be integrated into our overall percept of dot density/numerosity, although different observers use different strategies. If, however, both monocular and binocular information is present, observers appear to ignore the purely monocular regions, relying solely on the binocular information when making density/numerosity judgments. Our work suggests that binocular regions are favored over monocular regions, such that information from monocular regions is effectively ignored when binocular regions are present in a scene.},

Individuals with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome cannot understand or engage in social situations despite preserved intellectual abilities. Recently, it has been suggested that oxytocin, a hormone known to promote mother-infant bonds, may be implicated in the social deficit of autism. We investigated the behavioral effects of oxytocin in 13 subjects with autism. In a simulated ball game where participants interacted with fictitious partners, we found that after oxytocin inhalation, patients exhibited stronger interactions with the most socially cooperative partner and reported enhanced feelings of trust and preference. Also, during free viewing of pictures of faces, oxytocin selectively increased patients' gazing time on the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0000343},
  abstract = {When the left and right eyes are simultaneously presented with different images, observers typically report exclusive awareness of only one image. This phenomenon is termed binocular rivalry, reflecting the fact that the dominant image alternates every few seconds in a cycle of perceptual competition that continues indefinitely. Despite the apparent continuity in perceptual switching, we now demonstrate that the initial ``onset'' period is fundamentally different to all subsequent rivalry epochs. Using brief intermittent presentations, rivalry dominance shows strong biases such that the same target is perceived with each successive stimulus onset. These biases remain consistent within any given location, but vary across the visual field in a distribution that is stable over multiple weeks but highly idiosyncratic across observers. If the presentation exceeds $\sim$1sec at any location, however, the very different and much more balanced alternations of sustained binocular rivalry become apparent. These powerful onset biases are observed with brief intermittent presentations at a single location or with continual smooth motion of the targets. Periods of adaptation to one of the rivaling targets induced local switches in dominance to the non-adapted target. However, these effects were generally limited to the spatial site of adaptation and had less influence over each subsequent cycle of the target. We conclude that onset rivalry is independent of sustained rivalry and cannot be explained by local regions of monocular dominance or memory of past perceptual history, but rather reflects low-level, spatially localized factors that are stable over periods of weeks. These findings suggest that brief presentation paradigms are inappropriate for their current use in studies of the mechanisms underlying sustained rivalry. However, brief presentations are ideal for investigating early stages of perceptual competition.},

We tested a potential behavioral footprint of this proposed imbalance using binocular rivalry, a visual phenomenon in which perceptual experience is thought to mirror the push and pull of excitatory and inhibitory cortical dynamics. In binocular rivalry, two monocularly presented images compete, leading to a percept that alternates between them. In a series of trials, we presented separate images of objects (e.g., a baseball and a broccoli) to each eye using a mirror stereoscope and asked human participants with autism and matched control subjects to continuously report which object they perceived, or whether they perceived a mixed percept. Individuals with autism demonstrated a slower rate of binocular rivalry alternations than matched control subjects, with longer durations of mixed percepts and an increased likelihood to revert to the previously perceived object when exiting a mixed percept. Critically, each of these findings was highly predictive of clinical measures of autistic symptomatology. Control ``playback'' experiments demonstrated that differences in neither response latencies nor response criteria could account for the atypical dynamics of binocular rivalry we observed in autistic spectrum conditions. Overall, these results may provide an index of atypical cortical dynamics that may underlie both the social and nonsocial symptoms of autism.},

  abstract = {Background
Atypical sensory processing is a common clinical observation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neural hyperexcitability has been suggested as the cause for sensory hypersensitivity, a frequently reported clinical observation in ASD. We examined visual evoked responses to parametric increases in stimulus contrast in order to model neural responsivity of sensory systems in ASD.

Methods
Thirteen high-functioning individuals with ASD and 12 typically developing (TD) individuals completed a steady-state visual evoked potential study. Stimuli were vertical circular gratings oscillating at 3.76~Hz at varying contrasts (5, 10, 20,\ldots, 90~\% contrast, 10 levels). The average spectral power at the stimulus oscillation frequency was calculated for each contrast level.

Results
The magnitude of evoked sensory responses increased at a significantly greater rate and resulted in disproportionately elevated activation with higher contrasts in the ASD group. Approximately 45~\% of ASD participants had rates of response increases greater than any TD participant. This alteration was highly associated with parental reports of these participants' sensory difficulties.

Conclusions
Greater increases in visual responses over contrast manipulation suggest heightened excitability in the sensory cortex in ASD participants. Heightened neural excitability was observed in a substantial portion but not all of the ASD participants. This pattern suggests that individuals with higher excitability may constitute a neurobiologically distinct subgroup requiring individualized treatment interventions.},

When embedded in adjacent distractors, a target becomes more difficult to perceive. The neural mechanism for this ubiquitous visual crowding effect remains unresolved [1,~2]. Stimuli presented on opposite sides of the vertical meridian initially project to different hemispheres, whereas stimuli with the same spatial distance but presented to one side of the vertical meridian project to the same hemisphere. Dissociation between visual spatial distance and cortical distance can also be found in V2 and V3 (quadrant representations of the visual hemifield) along the horizontal meridian. In the current study, we observed a strong crowding effect from spatially adjacent distractors with either Gabor or letter targets presented near the vertical or horizontal meridian. Interestingly, for a target presented near the vertical meridian, a distractor from the same side of the meridian (cortically near) had a significantly stronger crowding effect compared with an equidistant distractor presented on the opposite side (cortically remote). No such meridian modulation was observed across the horizontal meridian. These results constrain the cortical locus of the crowding effect to a stage in which left and right visual spaces are represented discontinuously but the upper and lower visual fields are represented continuously, likely beyond the early retinotopic areas.},

  abstract = {Sexually dimorphic behaviors, qualitative or quantitative differences in behaviors between the sexes, result from the activity of a sexually differentiated nervous system. Sensory cues and sex hormones control the entire repertoire of sexually dimorphic behaviors, including those commonly thought to be charged with emotion such as courtship and aggression. Such overarching control mechanisms regulate distinct genes and neurons that in turn specify the display of these behaviors in a modular manner. How such modular control is transformed into cohesive internal states that correspond to sexually dimorphic behavior is poorly understood. We summarize current understanding of the neural circuit control of sexually dimorphic behaviors from several perspectives, including how neural circuits in general, and sexually dimorphic neurons in particular, can generate sexually dimorphic behaviors, and how molecular mechanisms and evolutionary constraints shape these behaviors. We propose that emergent themes such as the modular genetic and neural control of dimorphic behavior are broadly applicable to the neural control of other behaviors.},

Here we explore the earliest levels of striate cortical processing: the first stage, where orientation sensitivity emerges, and the second stage, where stimulus selectivity is further refined. The approach is whole cell recording from cat in vivo. Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus have circular receptive fields whose subregions, center and surround are concentrically arranged and have the reverse sign, on or off. These neurons supply cortical simple cells, whose receptive fields have on and off subregions that are elongated and lie side by side. Feedforward models hold that orientation sensitivity depends on this thalamocortical change in receptive field structure and an arrangement within subregions such that stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke synaptic responses of the opposite polarity-push-pull. Our work provides support for feedforward models and emphasizes that push-pull is key in the geniculostriate pathway, preserved from retina by thalamic relay cells and reiterated, point by point, by cortical simple cells. Also, we help define the cortical push-pull circuit by identifying inhibitory simple cells. Lastly, separate experiments that compare the first and second levels of cortical processing suggest that differences in the synaptic physiology of connections at the two (thalamocortical versus intracortical) stages underlie differential selectivity for properties such as motion.},

This effect is reduced as target\textendash{}distractor distance increases, and it is eliminated entirely at a distance that is labeled the critical spacing point. Attention, distractor preview, and popout are each known to facilitate processing in crowded displays. Eight experiments examined whether this is accomplished via a reduction in critical spacing. Attention was manipulated via spatial cueing, whereby a peripheral cue elicited a stimulus-driven shift of attention. Distractor preview was examined by manipulating whether the crowding distractors were presented prior to or simultaneous with the target. Popout was examined by manipulating whether there was a salient color difference between the target and distractors. As demonstrated in previous studies, we found robust benefits of spatial cueing, preview, and popout in crowded displays. However, although spatial cueing led to robust improvements in target discrimination, there was no reduction in critical spacing for attended stimuli. By contrast, both preview and popout caused large reductions in critical spacing. These disparate results indicate that attention improves target discrimination in crowded displays in a qualitatively different manner than do the other factors.},

This study uses visual search and crowding paradigms to probe the relative ability of children with autism, compared to normal developments children, to extract individual targets from cluttered backgrounds both within and outside the crowding regime. The data show that standard search follows the same pattern in the ASD and control groups with a strong effect of the set size that is substantially weakened by cueing the target location with a synchronous spatial cue. On the other hand, the crowding effect of eight flankers surrounding a small peripheral target is virtually absent in the clinical sample, indicating a superior ability to segregate cluttered visual items. This data, along with evidence of an impairment to the neural system for binding contours in ASD, bring additional support to the general idea of a shift of the trade-off between integration and segregation toward the latter. More specifically, they show that when discriminability is balanced across conditions, an advantage in odd-man out tasks is evident in ASD observers only within the crowding regime, when binding mechanism might get compulsorily triggered in normal observers.},

We here review recent progresses that have been made both at the experimental and theoretical levels in the description of these so-called "Center/Surround" modulations and in the understanding of their neural basis. Without denying the role of a modulatory feedback from higher cortical areas, recent results support the view that some of these phenomena result from the dynamic interplay between feedforward projections and horizontal intracortical connectivity in V1. Uncovering the functional role of the contextual periphery of cortical receptive fields has become an area of active investigation. The detailed comparison of electrophysiological and psychophysical data reveals strong correlations between the integrative behavior of V1 cells and some aspects of "low-level" and "mid-level" conscious perception. These suggest that as early as the V1 stage, the visual system is able to make use of contextual cues to recover local visual scene properties or correct their interpretation. Promising ideas have emerged on the importance of such a strategy for the coding of visual scenes, and the processing of static and moving objects.},

  abstract = {Sensation/novelty-seeking is amongst the best markers of cocaine addiction in humans. However, its implication in the vulnerability to cocaine addiction is still a matter of debate, as it is unclear whether this trait precedes or follows the development of addiction. Sensation/novelty-seeking trait has been identified in rats on the basis of either novelty-induced locomotor activity (high-responder (HR) trait) or novelty-induced place preference (high-novelty-preference trait (HNP)). HR and HNP traits have been associated with differential sensitivity to psychostimulants. However, it has recently been demonstrated that HR rats do not develop compulsive cocaine self-administration (SA) after protracted exposure to the drug, thereby suggesting that at least one dimension of sensation/novelty seeking in the rat is dissociable from the vulnerability to switch from controlled to compulsive cocaine SA. We therefore investigated whether HNP, as measured as the propensity to choose a new environment in a free choice procedure, as opposed to novelty-induced locomotor activity, predicts the vulnerability to, and the severity of, addiction-like behavior for cocaine. For this, we identified HR/LR rats and HNP/LNP rats before any exposure to cocaine. After 60 days of cocaine SA, each rat was given an addiction score based on three addiction-like behaviors (persistence of responding when the drug is signaled as not available, high breakpoint under progressive ratio schedule and resistance to punishment) that resemble the clinical features of drug addiction, namely inability to refrain from drug seeking, high motivation for the drug and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences. We show that, as opposed to HR rats, HNP rats represent a sub-population predisposed to compulsive cocaine intake, displaying higher addiction scores than LNP rats. This study thereby provides new insights into the factors predisposing to cocaine addiction, supporting the hypothesis that addiction is sustained by two vulnerable phenotypes: a 'drug use prone' phenotype such as HR which brings an individual to develop drug use and an 'addiction prone' phenotype, such as HNP, which facilitates the shift from sustained to compulsive drug intake and addiction.},

  abstract = {A recent series of experiments demonstrated a surprising deterioration of visual motion discrimination with increasing stimulus size for stimuli of high contrast. This counterintuitive finding was explained as a result of surround suppression in visual area V5. Equally paradoxical was the finding that older observers showed better performance than younger observers. This second result was explained as an age-related reduction in surround suppression due to changes in GABA-mediated inhibition. Using an opponent motion stimulus, we find an analogous effect and also find that this effect is much reduced in older observers, to the point where they perform better than younger observers. Our long duration stimulus should be beyond the range at which surround-suppressed neurons in V5 are preferentially activated. Having normalized our stimuli relative to contrast threshold, we show that our results can be entirely explained by the relative contrast of the stimulus and speculate that contrast sensitivity may play a role in previously reported results. Our older observers' data similarly can be explained by the relative contrast of the stimulus. The difference between older and younger observers appears to be a result of a weakening of spatial summation at high contrast in younger observers, perhaps caused by earlier saturation of motion mechanisms.},

We manipulated participants' expectations for hearing speech at different periods within a speech decision-making task. Patients activated a voice-sensitive region of the auditory cortex while they experienced AVHs in the scanner and displayed a concomitant deficit in prediction error signals in a similar portion of auditory cortex. This prediction error deficit correlated strongly with increased activity during silence and with reduced volumes of the auditory cortex, two established neural phenotypes of AVHs. Furthermore, patients with more severe AVHs had more deficient prediction error signals and greater activity during silence within the region of auditory cortex where groups differed, regardless of the severity of psychotic symptoms other than AVHs. Our findings suggest that deficient predictive coding accounts for the resting hyperactivity in sensory cortex that leads to hallucinations.},

This review evaluates the quality of the evidence bearing on these three phenomena. We argue that while superior local processing has been robustly demonstrated, conclusions about global processing cannot be definitively drawn from the experiments to date, which have generally not precluded observers using more local cues. Perception of moving stimuli is impaired in ASD, but explanations in terms of magnocellular/dorsal deficits do not appear to be sufficient. We suggest that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) may provide a neural basis for the range of motion-processing deficits observed in ASD, including biological motion perception. Such an explanation may also provide a link between perceptual abnormalities and specific deficits in social cognition associated with autism.},

  abstract = {An established neural biomarker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has the potential to provide novel biological and pharmacological targets for treatment. Lower level of inhibition in brain circuits is a leading biomarker candidate. A physiological investigation of the functional levels of inhibition in the cortex of individuals with autism can provide a strong test of the hypothesis. The amplitude of cortical response to the stimulation of adjacent fingers is controlled by the level of cortical inhibition and provides just such a test. Using magnetoencephalography, we recorded the response of the somatosensory cortex to the passive tactile stimulation of the thumb (D1), and index finger (D2), and to the simultaneous stimulation of both fingers combined (D1,D2) of the dominant (right) hand of young subjects with and without autism. For each participant, we measured the response to the stimulation of both fingers combined (D1,D2) relative to the post hoc sum of the responses to the stimulation of each finger alone (D1+D2) in multiple different ways and linearly regressed the ASD and neurotypical (NT) groups' responses. The resulting slopes were then compared: Smaller slope values imply attenuated response to paired finger stimulation, and enhanced levels of inhibition. The short-latency M40 and mid-latency M80 response slopes of the group with autism obtained in different ways were either significantly smaller, or statistically indistinguishable from NT. The result does not support reduced inhibition in the somatosensory cortex of individuals with autism, contrary to the seminal hypothesis of reduced inhibition. Implications are discussed including refinements of current theory.

  abstract = {To understand conscious vision, scientists must elucidate how the brain selects specific visual signals for awareness. When different monocular patterns are presented to the two eyes, they rival for conscious expression such that only one monocular image is perceived at a time. Controversy surrounds whether this binocular rivalry reflects neural competition among pattern representations or monocular channels. Here we show that rivalry arises from interocular competition, using functional magnetic resonance imaging of activity in a monocular region of primary visual cortex corresponding to the blind spot. This cortical region greatly prefers stimulation of the ipsilateral eye to that of the blind-spot eye. Subjects reported their dominant percept while viewing rivalrous orthogonal gratings in the visual location corresponding to the blind spot and its surround. As predicted by interocular rivalry, the monocular blind-spot representation was activated when the ipsilateral grating became perceptually dominant and suppressed when the blind-spot grating became dominant. These responses were as large as those observed during actual alternations between the gratings, indicating that rivalry may be fully resolved in monocular visual cortex. Our findings provide the first physiological evidence, to our knowledge, that interocular competition mediates binocular rivalry, and indicate that V1 may be important in the selection and expression of conscious visual information.},

  doi = {10.1167/14.10.672},
  abstract = {Background. It has been suggested that atypical visuo-spatial perception in autism may originate from altered local connectivity mediating the response properties of early visual feature detectors. The goal of this study was to assess lateral interactions between neurons within early visual areas in autism by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) elicited by windmill-dartboard (Ratliff \& Zemon, 1982) and lateral masking paradigms (Polat et al, 1997). Method. Nine participants with autism and 9 typically developing participants, matched for full-scale IQ and age (18-30 years), were asked to passively view visual stimuli during windmill-dartboard and lateral masking paradigms while ssVEPs from four electrodes over the occipital cortex (Oz, POz, O1 and O2) were collected. For the windmill-dartboard paradigm, first- and second-harmonic components of the steady-state responses were used to calculate indices reflecting facilitatory (FI) and inhibitory (SI) cortical interactions for all participants. For lateral masking paradigm, ssVEP data was collected while participants viewed Gabor patches presented either in isolation (target), or flanked by collinear Gabors at different contrasts (8, 16, 30\%) at target-flanker distances (1.5$\lambda$, 3 $\lambda$, 6 $\lambda$). Results. Group differences were not evidenced for either FI or SI cortical interaction indices obtained during the windmill-dartboard task. For the lateral masking paradigm, an expected difference between collinear and orthogonal Gabors (presented at a contrast of 16\%) at target-flanker distances of 1.5 $\lambda$ was found in the control group, p = 0.018. Importantly, this difference was not evidenced for the autism group. Conclusion. Our results suggest that FI and SI cortical interactions within early visual brain areas are similar in autism and control groups. However, group differences on the lateral masking paradigm are consistent with the hypotheses that lateral connectivity within early visual areas is atypical in autism, and could be considered a possible early neural origin for altered perception in autism.

  abstract = {When the two eyes view discrepant monocular stimuli, stable single vision gives way to alternating periods of monocular dominance; this is the well-known but little understood phenomenon of binocular rivalry. This article develops a neural theory of binocular rivalry that treats the phenomenon as the default outcome when binocular correspondence cannot be established. The theory posits the existence of monocular and binocular neurons arrayed within a functional processing module, with monocular neurons playing a crucial role in signaling the stimulus conditions instigating rivalry and generating inhibitory signals to implement suppression. Suppression is conceived as a local process happening in parallel over the entire cortical representation of the binocular visual field. The strength of inhibition causing suppression is related to the size of the pool of monocular neurons innervated by the suppressed eye, and the duration of a suppression phase is attributed to the strength of excitation generated by the suppressed stimulus. The theory is compared with three other contemporary theories of binocular rivalry. The article closes with a discussion of some of the unresolved problems related to the theory.

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon that occurs when a different image is presented to each eye. The observer generally perceives just one image at a time, with perceptual switches occurring every few seconds. A natural assumption is that this perceptual mutual exclusivity is achieved via mutual inhibition between populations of neurons that encode for either percept. Theoretical models that incorporate mutual inhibition have been largely successful at capturing experimental features of rivalry, including Levelt's propositions, which characterize perceptual dominance durations as a function of image contrasts. However, basic mutual inhibition models do not fully comply with Levelt's fourth proposition, which states that percepts alternate faster as the stimulus contrasts to both eyes are increased simultaneously. This theory-experiment discrepancy has been taken as evidence against the role of mutual inhibition for binocular rivalry. Here, we show how various biophysically plausible modifications to mutual inhibition models can resolve this problem.},

  abstract = {The expression patterns of 13 GABAA receptor subunit encoding genes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 3, gamma 1-gamma 3, delta) were determined in adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. Each mRNA displayed a unique distribution, ranging from ubiquitous (alpha 1 mRNA) to narrowly confined (alpha 6 mRNA was present only in cerebellar granule cells). Some neuronal populations coexpressed large numbers of subunit mRNAs, whereas in others only a few GABAA receptor-specific mRNAs were found. Neocortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen displayed complex expression patterns, and these areas probably contain a large diversity of GABAA receptors. In many areas, a consistent coexpression was observed for alpha 1 and beta 2 mRNAs, which often colocalized with gamma 2 mRNA. The alpha 1 beta 2 combination was abundant in olfactory bulb, globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, medial septum, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also apparent for the alpha 2 and beta 3 mRNAs, and these predominated in areas such as amygdala and hypothalamus. The alpha 3 mRNA occurred in layers V and VI of neocortex and in the reticular thalamic nucleus. In much of the forebrain, with the exception of hippocampal pyramidal cells, the alpha 4 and delta transcripts appeared to codistribute. In thalamic nuclei, the only abundant GABAA receptor mRNAs were those of alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta. In the medial geniculate thalamic nucleus, alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, delta, and gamma 3 mRNAs were the principal GABAA receptor transcripts. The alpha 5 and beta 1 mRNAs generally colocalized and may encode predominantly hippocampal forms of the GABAA receptor. These anatomical observations support the hypothesis that alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors are responsible for benzodiazepine I (BZ I) binding, whereas receptors containing alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 contribute to subtypes of the BZ II site. Based on significant mismatches between alpha 4/delta and gamma mRNAs, we suggest that in vivo, the alpha 4 subunit contributes to GABAA receptors that lack BZ modulation.},

Here we use molecular genetic approaches to map the functional connectivity of a subpopulation of GABA-containing neurons, located in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl), which express protein kinase C-$\delta$ (PKC-$\delta$). Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in amygdala slices and cell-specific viral tracing indicate that PKC-$\delta$+ neurons inhibit output neurons in the medial central amygdala (CEm), and also make reciprocal inhibitory synapses with PKC-$\delta$- neurons in CEl. Electrical silencing of PKC-$\delta$+ neurons in vivo suggests that they correspond to physiologically identified units that are inhibited by the conditioned stimulus, called CEloff units. This correspondence, together with behavioural data, defines an inhibitory microcircuit in CEl that gates CEm output to control the level of conditioned freezing.

  volume = {140},
  issn = {0033-3158},
  abstract = {Second order schedules of IV cocaine reinforcement in rats provide a reliable method for evaluating the effects of conditioned stimuli on cocaine-seeking behaviour, and for measuring the motivational aspects of cocaine reinforcement. In the procedure established here, each infusion of cocaine (0.25 mg/infusion) was initially made contingent on a lever press and was paired with a 20-s light conditioned stimulus (CS). When rats acquired stable rates of cocaine self-administration, the response requirement for cocaine was increased progressively to a second-order schedule of the type FI15 min(FR10:S), whereby the IV cocaine infusion was self-administered following the completion of the first FR10 responses (and CS presentation) after a 15-min fixed interval (FI) had elapsed. Evaluation of the animals' responding during the first, drug-free interval of each daily session provided a measure of cocaine-seeking behaviour, independent of other pharmacological effects of the self-administered drug. Thus, a dose-response study (dose range: 0.083, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/infusion) revealed that responding under this schedule during the initial, drug-free interval changed monotonically with dose, whereas an inverse relationship between cocaine dose and response level tended to appear during the rest of the session, after rats had self-administered the drug. Responding under this schedule was also shown to occur under the control of the CS, which had acquired conditioned reinforcing properties. Thus, a decrease in responding and an increase in the latency to initiate responding followed the omission of the CS for 3 consecutive days. In addition, extinction of cocaine-seeking behaviour was slower when contingent CS presentations occurred compared to extinction when the CS was not present. Furthermore, the reinstatement of responding for cocaine, which followed a brief period of non-contingent CS presentations, was retarded when this conditioned reinforcer had been extinguished together with cocaine. Finally, cocaine-seeking behaviour decreased markedly for the first 6 h that followed a 12-h period of continuous access to cocaine, when compared to responding 6 h after a 90-min session of limited access to the drug. Responding subsequently increased to baseline levels within 72 h. These results emphasise the utility of second-order schedules for studying drug-seeking behaviour and the importance of drug-associated cues in maintaining such responding for cocaine.},

  abstract = {Ever since Wheatstone initiated the scientific study of binocular rivalry, it has been debated whether the phenomenon is under attentional control. In recent years, the issue of attentional modulation of binocular rivalry has seen a revival. Here we review the classical studies as well as recent advances in the study of attentional modulation of binocular rivalry. We show that (1) voluntary control over binocular rivalry is possible, yet limited, (2) both endogenous and exogenous attention influence perceptual dominance during rivalry, (3) diverting attention from rival displays does not arrest perceptual alternations, and that (4) rival targets by themselves can also attract attention. From a theoretical perspective, we suggest that attention affects binocular rivalry by modulating the effective contrast of the images in competition. This contrast enhancing effect of top-down attention is counteracted by a response attenuating effect of neural adaptation at early levels of visual processing, which weakens the response to the dominant image. Moreover, we conclude that although frontal and parietal brain areas involved in both binocular rivalry and visual attention overlap, an adapting reciprocal inhibition arrangement at early visual cortex is sufficient to trigger switches in perceptual dominance independently of a higher-level ``selection'' mechanisms. Both of these processes are reciprocal and therefore self-balancing, with the consequence that complete attentional control over binocular rivalry can never be realized.},

  volume = {8},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0076134},
  abstract = {PurposeWe sought brain activity that predicts visual consciousness.MethodsWe used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity to a 1000-ms display of sine-wave gratings, oriented vertically in one eye and horizontally in the other. This display yields binocular rivalry: irregular alternations in visual consciousness between the images viewed by the eyes. We replaced both gratings with 200 ms of darkness, the gap, before showing a second display of the same rival gratings for another 1000 ms. We followed this by a 1000-ms mask then a 2000-ms inter-trial interval (ITI). Eleven participants pressed keys after the second display in numerous trials to say whether the orientation of the visible grating changed from before to after the gap or not. Each participant also responded to numerous non-rivalry trials in which the gratings had identical orientations for the two eyes and for which the orientation of both either changed physically after the gap or did not.ResultsWe found that greater activity from lateral occipital-parietal-temporal areas about 180 ms after initial onset of rival stimuli predicted a change in visual consciousness more than 1000 ms later, on re-presentation of the rival stimuli. We also found that less activity from parietal, central, and frontal electrodes about 400 ms after initial onset of rival stimuli predicted a change in visual consciousness about 800 ms later, on re-presentation of the rival stimuli. There was no such predictive activity when the change in visual consciousness occurred because the stimuli changed physically.ConclusionWe found early EEG activity that predicted later visual consciousness. Predictive activity 180 ms after onset of the first display may reflect adaption of the neurons mediating visual consciousness in our displays. Predictive activity 400 ms after onset of the first display may reflect a less-reliable brain state mediating visual consciousness.},

  abstract = {Primary visual coding can be characterized by the receptive field (RF) properties of single neurons. Subject of this paper is our search for a global,second coding step beyond the RF-concept that links related features in a visual scene. In recent models of visual coding, oscillatory activities have been proposed to constitute such linking signals. We tested the neurophysiological relevance of this hypothesis for the visual system. Single and multiple spikes as well as local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from several locations in the primary visual cortex (A17 and A18) using 7 or 19 individually advanceable fibermicroelectrodes (250 or 330 $\mu$m apart).Stimulusevoked (SE)-resonances of 35\textendash{}85 Hz were found in these three types of signals throughout the visual cortex when the primary coding channels were activated by their specific stimuli. Stimulus position, orientation, movement direction and velocity, ocularity and stationary flicker caused specific SE-resonances.Coherent SE-resonances were found at distant cortical positions when at least one of the primary coding properties was similar. Coherence was found1) within a vertical cortex column,2) between neighbouring hypercolumns, and3) between two different cortical areas. We assume that the coherence of SE-resonances is mediated by recurrent excitatory intra- and inter-areal connections via phase locking between assemblies that represent the linking features of the actual visual scene. Visually related activities are, thus, transiently labelled by a temporal code that signalizes their momentary association.},

This case\textendash{}control pilot study (N~=~24) compared baseline and working memory task-induced neuronal oscillations acquired with high-density electroencephalograms (EEGs) to GABA levels measured in vivo with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Working memory performance, baseline GABA level in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and measures of gamma oscillations from EEGs at baseline and during a working memory task were obtained.~A major limitation of this study is a relatively small sample size for several analyses due to the integration of diverse methodologies and participant compliance. Working memory performance was significantly lower for patients than for controls. During the working memory task, patients (n~=~7) had significantly lower amplitudes in gamma oscillations than controls (n~=~9). However, both at rest and across working memory stages, there were significant correlations between gamma oscillation amplitude and left DLPFC GABA level. Peak gamma frequency during the encoding stage of the working memory task (n~=~16) significantly correlated with GABA level and working memory performance. Despite gamma band amplitude deficits in patients across working memory stages, both baseline and working memory-induced gamma oscillations showed strong dependence on baseline GABA levels in patients and controls. These findings suggest a critical role for GABA function in gamma band oscillations, even under conditions of system and cognitive impairments as seen in schizophrenia.},

Here, we discuss recent evidence showing that activation of metabotropic GABAB receptors in cortical layer 1 can powerfully inhibit principal cell activity and that their activation can rapidly halt ongoing network activity. Inputs from both within and outwith the cortex converge upon layer 1 where they target various populations of interneurons, including neurogliaform cells. We argue that neurogliaform cells are the main effector of a powerful inhibitory circuit that, acting through GABAB receptors, can be differentially recruited by long-range connections to serve in roles as diverse as conscious perception and memory consolidation.},

  issn = {0006-3223},
  doi = {10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.03.032},
  abstract = {Background
Clinically and biologically, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous. Unusual patterns of visual preference as indexed by eye tracking are hallmarks; however, whether they can be used to define an early biomarker of ASD as a whole or leveraged to define a subtype is unclear. To begin to examine this issue, large cohorts are required.
Methods
A sample of 334 toddlers from six distinct groups (115 toddlers with ASD, 20 toddlers with ASD features, 57 toddlers with developmental delay, 53 toddlers with other conditions [e.g., premature birth, prenatal drug exposure], 64 toddlers with typical development, and 25 unaffected toddlers with siblings with ASD) was studied. Toddlers watched a movie containing geometric and social images. Fixation duration and number of saccades within each area of interest and validation statistics for this independent sample were computed. Next, to maximize power, data from our previous study (n = 110) were added for a total of 444 subjects. A subset of toddlers repeated the eye-tracking procedure.
Results
As in the original study, a subset of toddlers with ASD fixated on geometric images \&gt;69\% of the time. Using this cutoff, sensitivity for ASD was 21\%, specificity was 98\%, and positive predictive value was 86\%. Toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred geometric images had 1) worse cognitive, language, and social skills relative to toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred social images and 2) fewer saccades when viewing geometric images. Unaffected siblings of ASD probands did not show evidence of heightened preference for geometric images. Test-retest reliability was good. Examination of age effects suggested that this test may not be appropriate with children \&gt;4 years old.
Conclusions
Enhanced visual preference for geometric repetition may be an early developmental biomarker of an ASD subtype with more severe symptoms.},

  abstract = {1. The mechanisms involved in the lability of inhibition at higher frequencies of stimulation were investigated in the guinea-pig in vitro neocortical slice preparation by intracellular recording techniques. We attempted to test the possibility of a feedback depression of GABA on subsequent release. 2. At resting membrane potential (Em, -75.8 +/- 5.2 mV) stimulation of either the pial surface or subcortical white matter evoked a sequence of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing synaptic components in most neurones. An early hyperpolarizing component (IPSPA) was usually only obvious as a pronounced termination of the EPSP, followed by a later hyperpolarizing event (IPSPB). Current-voltage relationships revealed two different conductances of about 200 and 20 nS and reversal potentials of -73.0 +/- 4.4 and -88.6 +/- 6.1 mV for the early and late component, respectively. 3. The conductances of IPSPA and IPSPB were fairly stable at a stimulus frequency of 0.1 Hz. At frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz both IPSPs were attenuated with the second stimulus and after about five stimuli a steady state was reached. Concomitantly IPSPs were shortened. The average decrease in synaptic conductance between 0.1 and 1 Hz was 80\% for the IPSPA and 60\% for the IPSPB. At these frequencies the reversal potentials decreased by 5 and 2 mV, respectively; Em and input resistance (Rin) were not consistently affected. 4. The amplitudes of field potentials, action potentials and EPSPs of pyramidal cells were attenuated less than 10\% at stimulus frequencies up to 1 Hz, suggesting that alterations in local circuits between the stimulation site and excitatory input onto inhibitory interneurones may play only a minor role in the frequency-dependent decay of IPSPs. 5. Localized application of GABA produced multiphasic responses. With low concentrations and application near the soma an early hyperpolarization prevailed followed by a depolarizing late component. Brief application of GABA at low frequencies induced constant responses; at higher frequencies, the responses sometimes declined. The current-voltage relationships of the two GABA responses were similar to each other and to the early IPSP. An apparently fivefold higher conductance was estimated at lower Ems, suggesting that the GABA response had a voltage sensitivity. The slope conductance of IPSPs was decreased by up to 50\% for tens of seconds after postsynaptically detectable effects of GABA had dissipated. 6. Application of the GABA uptake inhibitor nipecotic acid (50-500 microM) reduced the conductance of both components of orthodromically evoked inhibition and shortened the IPSP at low frequencies, but had no additional effects at higher stimulation rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The modulation of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) by attention was studied in detail using 15 ``tag'' frequencies in the range of 2.5\textendash{}20 Hz. The stimuli were two series of random disc search arrays superimposed on two concentric color-marked annuli respectively. Two series of arrays were updated independently; one updated at one fixed frequency (flicker) and the other updated randomly according to a white noise distribution (random broadband flicker, rbbf). On each trial, the subject was instructed to attend one annulus and to detect a target (a triangle) that occasionally appeared in a random disc array in the attended annulus. The SSVEP results show that the choice of flicker frequency selects which cortical network synchronizes to the flicker frequency; two distinct cortical networks showed different effects of attention. SSVEP power and the effects of attention on SSVEP power strongly depend on both flicker frequency and radial position of rbbf annulus. At flicker frequencies in the delta band (2\textendash{}4 Hz), and in the upper alpha band (10\textendash{}11 Hz), an occipital-frontal network appears to phase-lock to the flicker when attending to the flicker, increasing the magnitude of the SSVEP. At flicker frequencies in the lower alpha band (8\textendash{}10 Hz), a global response to a peripheral flickering stimulus, that includes parietal cortex and posterior frontal cortex, has higher amplitude when attention is directed away from the flickering peripheral stimulus and towards a competing rbbf stimulus in the fovea. Increases in SSVEP power when attention is directed to peripheral flicker are always associated with increases in phase locking. By contrast, at frequencies in the lower alpha band, increases in SSVEP power when attention is directed away from the flicker and towards foveal stimuli are not associated with changes in phase-locking. Thus, whether attention to a flicker stimulus increases or decreases SSVEP amplitude and phase locking depends on which of two cortical networks is selected by the flicker frequency; different networks have distinct spatial and dynamic properties.},

  abstract = {We have investigated an unusual form of binocular rivalry between two images that are flickered one to each eye, but are never presented simultaneously to the observer. The images were presented in alternation, with a brief dark period between the images. When the flicker frequency was $<$5 Hz, the subjects primarily experienced a unitary flicker that alternated between the two images. When the flicker frequency was $>$5 Hz, the subjects primarily experienced two single-image flickers that rival. We investigated magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses at the flicker frequency of the rival stimuli. We found that at some recording locations responses are phase-locked to the flicker that is consciously being perceived. At each flicker rate that induced rivalry, phase shifts following the conscious percept were found consistently at MEG sensors over midline frontal lobe. Most of these sensors show higher magnitude responses when two rivaling flickers are perceived than when a unitary alternating color flicker is perceived. At sensors over occipital lobe, the sensor locations that phase-locked to the perceived flicker depended on the color, orientation, and frequency of flicker. By contrast, sensors over parietal cortex respond preferentially to one flicker, even as the conscious percept changes. Apparently, a large-scale network of cell assemblies in occipital and frontal cortex, responds preferentially to the perceived stimulus during rivalry, and is sensitive to the timing of the flicker driving the conscious percept.},

  abstract = {We conducted behavioral and EEG experiments to identify physiological correlates of perceptual binding during two types of binocular rivalry: (1) conventional `eye' rivalry where perception alternates between the two monocular images presented one to each eye and (2) interocular `percept' rivalry, where perception alternates between percepts formed by grouping complementary hemifields one from each eye. We employed `frequency-tagging' by flickering a grating in each hemifield of each eye at different frequencies to elicit SSVEP responses specific to each hemifield of each eye. When the gratings in complementary visual fields of the two eyes were congruent in color and orientation, robust interocular `percept' rivalry was observed with roughly equal probability to conventional `eye' rivalry. The SSVEPs evoked by the flickering gratings were enhanced by conscious perception at both posterior and frontal electrodes only during conventional `eye' rivalry and not during interocular `percept' rivalry, suggesting that dominance of one eye is the basis of most previous reports of SSVEP modulation by conscious perception. We also observed nonlinear SSVEP responses at the sums of our four fundamental frequencies. These combination responses were only produced by flicker in complementary visual hemifields \textendash{} in the same eye or across eyes, but never by incongruent flickering gratings that occupy the same visual field across eyes, suggesting that they are related to the binding of the visual hemifields (monocular or interocular) into a coherent percept. These combination responses were modulated by the type of rivalry experienced by the observer, but not by the specific conscious perception. Neural processes related to perceptual binding of both rival percepts take place during binocular rivalry even when only one percept is consciously perceived. This suggests that conventional `eye' and interocular `percept' rivalry both involve competition between percepts.},

EEG was recorded from six adolescents with autism and eight controls matched on chronological age, and verbal and nonverbal mental age, whilst identifying the presence or absence of an illusory Kanizsa shape. Although there were no reaction time or accuracy differences between the groups there were significant task-related differences in cortical activity. Control participants showed typical gamma- band activity over parietal regions at around 350 msec post onset of shape trials, similar to gamma patterns found in previous studies with non-impaired adults. In contrast, autistic participants showed overall increased activity, including an early 100 msec gamma peak and a late induced peak, 50 to 70 msec earlier than that shown by the control group. We interpret the abnormal gamma activity to reflect decreased ``signal to noise'' due to decreased inhibitory processing. In this experiment we did not establish a link between altered perception and abnormal gamma, as the autistic participants' behaviour did not differ from the controls. Future work should be designed to replicate this phenomenon and establish the perceptual consequences of altered gamma activity.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that early event-related potentials are a result of phase alignment of ongoing background oscillations of the electroencephalogram rather than additive amplitude modulation. Steady state visual-evoked potentials (ssVEPs) can be recorded using an intensity modulated stimulus, resulting in an evoked brain response at a known frequency, i.e. the stimulation frequency. Given this property, the ssVEP is ideally suited for examining the relationship between single-trial fluctuations in phase/amplitude and the evoked brain potential resulting from averaging across trials. To address this issue, the current study investigated the contribution of single trial power and intertrial phase locking to ssVEP generation by presenting a peripheral flicker. Further, transient stimuli were presented during flicker and at three increasing latency lags following flicker offset to examine (1) to what extent a stimulus can disturb the ssVEP oscillation and (2) how phase alignment during P1-N1-P2 time windows is affected during presence of evoked oscillations. The former assessment evaluates the stability of ssVEPs and the latter the phase alignment processes to transient stimuli under experimentally induced background oscillations. We observed that ssVEPs are a result of phase alignment rather than single trial amplitude modulation. In addition, ssVEP oscillations were not disturbed by transient stimuli. Finally, phase alignment in P1-N1-P2 time windows was distorted during and shortly after steady state stimulation. We conclude that ssVEPs represent strongly phase locked oscillations sharing the same generation mechanisms as early evoked potentials. Hum Brain Mapp, 2007. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this work, with wavelet analysis, a new parameter named stability coefficient (SC) was defined to measure the stability of a frequency, and then the electrode with the highest stability was selected as the signal electrode for further analysis. After that, the SC method and the traditional power spectrum (PS) method were used comparatively to recognize the stimulus frequency from an analogous BCI data constructed from a real SSVEP data, and the results showed that the SC method is better for a short time window data.},

Movement selectivity is a defining characteristic of neurons involved in movement perception, including mirror neurons, and, as such, these findings argue against a mirror system dysfunction in autism.},

Reference signals are derived from the visual stimulator that are related to corresponding harmonics of the response and the filter weights are adjusted so as to minimize the squared estimation error between the reference and the recorded signal using the recursive least squares (RLS) method. The filter, which acts as an adaptive bandpass filter, is followed by a detector based on the Tcirc2 statistic. The performance of the RLS adaptive filter was compared to that of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the filtered DFT of Tang and Norcia in a series of simulations with known sinusoids buried in Gaussian noise and in EEG noise. In the simulations, the RLS adaptive filter detected signals at about 3\textendash{}4 times lower signal to noise ratios than did the DFT. The RLS filter also outperformed the filtered DFT. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with human visual evoked potential recordings. The adaptive RLS filter significantly outperforms both the DFT and filtered DFT and is much simpler to implement than the filtered DFT method of Tang and Norcia.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by deficits in social and communication processes. Recent data suggest that altered functional connectivity (FC), i.e. synchronous brain activity, might contribute to these deficits. Of specific interest is the FC integrity of the default mode network (DMN), a network active during passive resting states and cognitive processes related to social deficits seen in ASD, e.g. Theory of Mind. We investigated the role of altered FC of default mode sub-networks (DM-SNs) in 16 patients with high-functioning ASD compared to 16 matched healthy controls of short resting fMRI scans using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a multivariate data-driven approach that identifies temporally coherent networks, providing a natural measure of FC. Results show that compared to controls, patients showed decreased FC between the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, DMN core areas, and other DM-SNs areas. FC magnitude in these regions inversely correlated with the severity of patients' social and communication deficits as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule and the Social Responsiveness Scale. Importantly, supplemental analyses suggest that these results were independent of treatment status. These results support the hypothesis that DM-SNs under-connectivity contributes to the core deficits seen in ASD. Moreover, these data provide further support for the use of data-driven analysis with resting-state data for illuminating neural systems that differ between groups. This approach seems especially well suited for populations where compliance with and performance of active tasks might be a challenge, as it requires minimal cooperation.},

For the sake of safety and comfort, the frequencies of the stimulus should be higher than 30 Hz. However, only a limited number of these frequencies can elicit SSVEPs that are strong enough for BCI purposes. In order to increase the number of available stimuli, the SSVEP phase can be taken into account. In this study, we used phase synchrony analysis to extract the phase difference between SSVEP and stimuli as a feature to identify a subject's intention. This analysis can mitigate the adverse effect brought by the phase deviation that may occur in the stimuli. Furthermore, the classification accuracy when using a single lead signal (Oz-Cz) is compared to a spatial filtered signal. The result shows that the phase synchrony analysis can effectively extract the phase difference and that spatial filtering can significantly increase the classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {During adolescence, white matter microstructure undergoes an important stage of development. It is hypothesized that the alterations of brain connectivity that have a key role in autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) may interact with the development of white matter microstructure. This interaction may be present beyond the phenotype of autism in siblings of individuals with ASC, who are 10 to 20 times more likely to develop certain forms of ASC. We use diffusion tensor imaging to examine how white matter microstructure measurements correlate with age in typically developing individuals, and how this correlation differs in n=43 adolescents with ASC and their n=38 siblings. Correlations observed in n=40 typically developing individuals match developmental changes noted in previous longitudinal studies. In comparison, individuals with ASC display weaker negative correlation between age and mean diffusivity in a broad area centred in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. These differences may be caused either by increased heterogeneity in ASC or by temporal alterations in the group's developmental pattern. Siblings of individuals with ASC also show diminished negative correlation between age and one component of mean diffusivity\textemdash{}second diffusion eigenvalue\textemdash{}in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. As the observed differences match for location and correlation directionality in our comparison of typically developing individuals to those with ASC and their siblings, we propose that these alterations constitute a part of the endophenotype of autism.},

Theoretical conceptions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and experimental studies of cerebral blood flow suggest abnormalities in connections among distributed neural systems in ASD.
Methods
Functional connectivity was assessed with electroencephalographic coherence between pairs of electrodes in a high-density electrode array in narrow frequency bands among 18 adults with ASD and 18 control adults in an eyes closed resting state.
Results
In the \texttheta{} (3\textendash{}6 Hz) frequency range, locally elevated coherence was evident for the ASD group, especially within left hemisphere frontal and temporal regions. In the lower $\alpha$ range (8\textendash{}10 Hz), globally reduced coherence was evident for the ASD group within frontal regions and between frontal and all other scalp regions. The ASD group exhibited significantly greater relative power between 3 and 6 Hz and 13\textendash{}17 Hz and significantly less relative power between 9 and 10 Hz.
Conclusions
Robust patterns of over- and under-connectivity are apparent at distinct spatial and temporal scales in ASD subjects in the eyes closed resting state.},

Networks modeled neuromagnetic signal interactions between sensors using three alternative interdependence measures: (a) a non-linear measure of generalized synchronization (robust interdependence measure [RIM]), (b) mutual information (MI), and (c) partial directed coherence (PDC). To summarize the information contained in each network model we employed well-established global graph measures (average strength, assortativity, clustering, and efficiency) as well as graph measures (average strength of edges) tailored to specific hypotheses concerning the spatial distribution of abnormalities in connectivity among individuals with ASD. Graph measures then served as features in leave-one-out classification analyses contrasting control and ASD participants. We found that combinations of regionally constrained graph measures, derived from RIM, performed best, discriminating between the two groups with 93.75\% accuracy. Network visualization revealed that ASD participants displayed significantly reduced interdependence strength, both within bilateral frontal and temporal sensors, as well as between temporal sensors and the remaining recording sites, in agreement with previous studies of functional connectivity in this disorder.},

We examined resting-state blood oxygen level\textendash{}dependent interhemispheric correlation in 53 males with high-functioning autism and 39 typically developing males from late childhood through early adulthood. By constructing spatial maps of correlation between homologous voxels in each hemisphere, we found significantly reduced interhemispheric correlation specific to regions with functional relevance to autism: sensorimotor cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. Observed interhemispheric connectivity differences were better explained by diagnosis of autism than by potentially confounding neuropsychological metrics of language, IQ, or handedness. Although both corpus callosal volume and gray matter interhemispheric connectivity were significantly reduced in autism, no direct relationship was observed between them, suggesting that structural and functional metrics measure different aspects of interhemispheric connectivity. In the control but not the autism sample, there was decreasing interhemispheric correlation with subject age. Greater differences in interhemispheric correlation were seen for more lateral regions in the brain. These findings suggest that long-range connectivity abnormalities in autism are spatially heterogeneous and that transcallosal connectivity is decreased most in regions with functions associated with behavioral abnormalities in autism. Autism subjects continue to show developmental differences in interhemispheric connectivity into early adulthood.},

  abstract = {Purpose:

To evaluate the reproducibility of $\gamma$-amino-butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate concentrations derived using three different spectral fitting methods, and to investigate gender-related differences in neurotransmitter levels.

Materials and Methods:

Single voxel MEGA-edited PRESS MR spectra were acquired from a 30-mL voxel in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex in 14 adult volunteers (7 female) at 3 Tesla (3T). For each participant, four consecutive resting spectra were acquired within the same scanning session. Metabolite concentrations were derived using LCModel, jMRUI, and locally written peak fitting software. The within-session reproducibility for each analysis method was calculated as the average coefficient of variation (CV) of the GABA and Glx (glutamate+glutamine) concentrations. Gender differences in GABA and Glx were evaluated using a two-tailed unpaired t-test.

Results:

LCModel provided the best reproducibility for both GABA (CV 7\%) and Glx (CV 6\%). GABA, Glx, and glutamate concentrations were significantly higher in the male participants, (P = 0.02, P = 0.001, and P $<$ 0.001, respectively).

Conclusion:

GABA and glutamate can be quantified in vivo with high reproducibility (CV 6\textendash{}7\%) using frequency-domain spectral fitting methods like LCModel. However, the GABA and glutamate concentrations vary significantly between men and women, emphasizing the importance of gender-matching for studies investigating differences in neurotransmitter concentrations between mixed-cohort groups.

  abstract = {$\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter of the human brain, and GABA-ergic dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent MRS techniques have allowed the quantification of GABA concentrations in vivo, and could therefore provide biologically relevant information. Few reports have formally characterized the reproducibility of these techniques, and differences in field strength, acquisition and processing parameters may result in large differences in measured GABA values. Here, we used a J-edited, single-voxel spectroscopy method of measurement of GABA\,+\,macromolecules (GABA\,+\,) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right frontal white matter (rFWM) at 3\,T. We measured the coefficient of variation within subjects (CVw) and intra-class correlation coefficients on two repeated scans obtained from 10 healthy volunteers with processing procedures developed in-house for the quantification of GABA\,+ and other major metabolites. In addition, by segmenting the spectroscopic voxel into cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter, and employing a linear regression technique to extrapolate metabolite values to pure gray and white matter, we determined metabolite differences between gray and white matter in ACC and rFWM.

Variability can be divided into intra-subject variability, reflecting noise within the time series, and inter-subject variability, reflecting subject-to-subject differences in activation. The purpose of this study was to obtain estimates of percent signal change and the two sources of variability from fMRI data, and then use these parameter estimates in simulation experiments in order to generate power curves. Of interest from these simulations were conclusions concerning how many subjects are needed and how many time points within a scan are optimal in an fMRI study of cognitive function. Intra-subject variability was estimated from resting conditions, and inter-subject variability and percent signal change were estimated from verbal working memory data. Simulations derived from these parameters illustrate how percent signal change, intra- and inter-subject variability, and number of time points affect power. An empirical test experiment, using fMRI data acquired during somatosensory stimulation, showed good correspondence between the simulation-based power predictions and the power observed within somatosensory regions of interest. Our analyses suggested that for a liberal threshold of 0.05, about 12 subjects were required to achieve 80\% power at the single voxel level for typical activations. At more realistic thresholds, that approach those used after correcting for multiple comparisons, the number of subjects doubled to maintain this level of power.},

  abstract = {Background
Recent neuroimaging studies of autism have indicated reduced functional connectivity during both cognitive tasks and rest. These data suggest long-range connectivity may be compromised in this disorder, and current neurological theories of autism contend disrupted inter-regional interactions may be an underlying mechanism explaining behavioral symptomatology. However, it is unclear whether deficient neuronal communication is attributable to fewer long-range tracts or more of a local deficit in neural circuitry. This study examines the integrity of local circuitry by focusing on gamma band activity in auditory cortices of children and adolescents with autism.
Methods
Ten children and adolescents with autism and 10 matched controls participated. Both groups listened to 500 ms duration monaural click trains with a 25 ms inter-click interval, as magnetoencephalography was acquired from the contralateral hemisphere. To estimate 40 Hz spectral power density, we performed time-frequency decomposition of the single-trial magnetic steady-state response data using complex demodulation.
Results
Children and adolescents with autism exhibited significantly reduced left hemispheric 40 Hz power from 200-500 ms post-stimulus onset. In contrast, no significant between group differences were observed for right hemispheric cortices.
Conclusions
The production and/or maintenance of left hemispheric gamma oscillations appeared abnormal in participants with autism. We interpret these data as indicating that in autism, particular brain regions may be unable to generate the high-frequency activity likely necessary for binding and other forms of inter-regional interactions. These findings augment connectivity theories of autism with novel evidence that aberrations in local circuitry could underlie putative deficiencies in long-range neural communication.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with disturbances of neural connectivity. Functional connectivity between neural structures is typically examined within the context of a cognitive task, but also exists in the absence of a task (i.e., ``rest''). Connectivity during rest is particularly active in a set of structures called the default network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus. We previously reported that adults with ASD relative to controls show areas of stronger and weaker connectivity within the default network. The objective of the present study was to examine the default network in adolescents with ASD. Sixteen adolescents with ASD and 15 controls participated in a functional MRI study. Functional connectivity was examined between a PCC seed and other areas of the default network. Both groups showed connectivity in the default network. Relative to controls, adolescents with ASD showed widespread weaker connectivity in nine of the eleven areas of the default network. Moreover, an analysis of symptom severity indicated that poorer social skills and increases in restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests correlated with weaker connectivity, whereas poorer verbal and non-verbal communication correlated with stronger connectivity in multiple areas of the default network. These findings indicate that adolescents with ASD show weaker connectivity in the default network than previously reported in adults with ASD. The findings also show that weaker connectivity within the default network is associated with specific impairments in ASD.},

  abstract = {Crowding, the inability to recognize an individual object in clutter (Bouma H. Nature 226: 177\textendash{}178, 1970), is considered a major impediment to object recognition in peripheral vision. Despite its significance, the cortical loci of crowding are not well understood. In particular, the role of the primary visual cortex (V1) remains unclear. Here we utilize a diagnostic feature of crowding to identify the earliest cortical locus of crowding. Controlling for other factors, radially arranged flankers induce more crowding than tangentially arranged ones (Toet A, Levi DM. Vision Res 32: 1349\textendash{}1357, 1992). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the change in mean blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response due to the addition of a middle letter between a pair of radially or tangentially arranged flankers. Consistent with the previous finding that crowding is associated with a reduced BOLD response [Millin R, Arman AC, Chung ST, Tjan BS. Cereb Cortex (July 5, 2013). doi:10.1093/cercor/bht159], we found that the BOLD signal evoked by the middle letter depended on the arrangement of the flankers: less BOLD response was associated with adding the middle letter between radially arranged flankers compared with adding it between tangentially arranged flankers. This anisotropy in BOLD response was present as early as V1 and remained significant in downstream areas. The effect was observed while subjects' attention was diverted away from the testing stimuli. Contrast detection threshold for the middle letter was unaffected by flanker arrangement, ruling out surround suppression of contrast response as a major factor in the observed BOLD anisotropy. Our findings support the view that V1 contributes to crowding.},

Little is known about the processes of grouping and their implementation in the visual system. Previously we described a configural effect in which the global arrangement (degree of co-circularity) of Gabor flankers affected the degree of crowding with a Gabor target that they surrounded. Here we tested possible mechanisms by which the configural effect might operate in crowding. We ruled out simple explanations based on the effect of basic units constructing these configurations (pairs of opposing Gabors). Our results support an explanation for crowding that is based on grouping processes between flankers. They also suggest that not all flankers necessarily directly affect the target. Flankers might group together and interact with the target as a single element. Finally, using a computational model of crowding based on compulsory grouping (following Gestalt principles) and segmentation, we define the relative contribution of different pair relations of grouped elements to crowding.},

Putting names to faces can sometimes be challenging, but humans are generally extremely good at recognising faces. Computers, on the other hand, often find it difficult to categorize a face as a face. Indeed, a major challenge in face recognition arises because faces come in many different shapes and sizes. Moreover, both the lighting conditions and the orientation of the head can change, which makes the challenge even more difficult.
Young infants also show a preference for pictures of human faces over nonsense images, which suggests that the ability to recognise faces is at least partly hard-wired. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that face recognition depends on activity in specific regions of the right hemisphere of the brain, and adults who sustain damage to these regions lose their face recognition skills.
De Heering and Rossion have now provided the first evidence that the right hemisphere is specialized for distinguishing between natural images of faces and `non-face objects' in infants as young as 4 to 6 months. By using scalp electrodes to record electrical activity in the brain as the infants viewed images on a screen, De Heering and Rossion showed that photographs of human faces triggered a distinct pattern of electrical activity in the right hemisphere: this pattern was clearly different to the patterns triggered by photographs of animals or objects.
A consistent response was triggered by faces of different genders and expressions, and by faces presented from various viewpoints and under different lighting conditions. In a control experiment, De Heering and Rossion demonstrated that low-level visual features such as differences in luminance or contrast do not contribute to this selective response to faces.
These results argue against the idea that face perception only becomes assigned to the right hemisphere of the brain when children learn to read (that is, when language processing begins to occupy parts of the left hemisphere). By generating significant responses in a short period of time (just five minutes or less), the protocol developed by De Heering and Rossion has the potential to prove very useful to researchers investigating developmental changes to the perception of visual images during childhood.

Whilst that test succeeded in discriminating a group of adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) from controls, it suffered from several psychometric problems. In this paper these limitations are rectified by revising the test. The Revised Eyes Test was administered to a group of adults with AS or HFA (N= 15) and again discriminated these from a large number of normal controls (N= 239) drawn from different samples. In both the clinical and control groups the Eyes Test was inversely correlated with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (the AQ), a measure of autistic traits in adults of normal intelligence. The Revised Eyes Test has improved power to detect subtle individual differences in social sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Gaze direction and especially direct gaze is a powerful nonverbal cue that plays an important role in social interactions. Here we studied the neural mechanisms underlying the privileged access of direct gaze to visual awareness. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy human volunteers who were exposed to faces with direct or averted gaze under continuous flash suppression, thereby manipulating their awareness of the faces. A gaze processing network comprising fusiform face area (FFA), superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, and intraparietal sulcus showed overall reduced neural responses when participants reported to be unaware of the faces. Interestingly, direct gaze elicited greater responses than averted gaze when participants were aware of the faces, but smaller responses when they were unaware. Additional between-subject correlation and single-trial analyses indicated that this pattern of results was due to a modulation of the relationship between neural responses and awareness by gaze direction: with increasing neural activation in the FFA, direct-gaze faces entered awareness more readily than averted-gaze faces. These findings suggest that for direct gaze, lower levels of neural activity are sufficient to give rise to awareness than for averted gaze, thus providing a neural basis for privileged access of direct gaze to awareness.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Another person's eye gaze directed at oneself is a powerful social signal acting as a catalyst for further communication. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms underlying the prioritized access of direct gaze to visual awareness in healthy human volunteers and show that with increasing neural activation, direct-gaze faces enter awareness more readily than averted-gaze faces. This suggests that for a socially highly relevant cue like direct gaze, lower levels of neural activity are sufficient to give rise to awareness compared with averted gaze, possibly because the human brain is attuned to the efficient neural processing of direct gaze due to the biological importance of eye contact for social interactions.},

Face recognition deficits have been implicated in the most common disorder of social interaction: autism. Here we ask: is face identity recognition in fact impaired in people with autism?

However, quantitatively \textendash{} i.e., how well facial identity is remembered or discriminated \textendash{} people with autism perform worse than typical individuals. This impairment is particularly clear in face memory and in face perception tasks in which a delay intervenes between sample and test, and less so in tasks with no memory demand.

Here we tested adaptation to loudness, a process that regulates incoming sensory input, in adults with ASD and matched controls. Simple loudness adaptation (SLA) is a fundamental adaptive process that reduces the subjective loudness of quiet steady-state sounds in the environment over time, whereas induced loudness adaptation (ILA) is a means of generating a reduction in the perceived volume of louder sounds. ASD participants showed a striking reduction in magnitude and rate of SLA relative to age and ability-matched typical adults, but in contrast ILA remained intact. Furthermore, rate of SLA predicted sensory sensitivity coping strategies in the ASD group. These results provide the first evidence that compromised neural mechanisms governing fundamental adaptive processes might account for sound sensitivity in ASD.},

  abstract = {Peripheral vision is characterized in part by poor spatial resolution and impaired visual performance, particularly when the object is surrounded by flanking elements, a phenomenon popularly known as ``crowding''. Crowding scales with eccentricity irrespective of the target size, both in terms of magnitude and spatial extent, which is determined by varying the target-flanker separation. However, the extent to which crowding depends upon the flanking stimuli parameters alone without separating target and flankers is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of flanking stimulus parameters on crowding in orientation and contrast discrimination tasks using closely located ``chain'' lateral Gabor stimuli in order to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of crowding in peripheral vision. We found a strong configural effect on crowding in both orientation and contrast discrimination tasks, with reduced crowding when the flanker parameters enhanced the target salience and increased crowding when the flankers were perceptually grouped with the target. While in orientation discrimination crowding was dependent on eccentricity, and in contrast discrimination it was dependent on flanker contrast and eccentricity, crowding showed little dependence on the number of flankers in either task. We conclude that crowding in peripheral orientation and contrast discrimination is configuration specific, which can be reduced without alterations to the target-flanker separation and that crowding is a combination of low-level as well as high-level cortical processing.},

  abstract = {The details of oriented visual stimuli are better resolved when they are horizontal or vertical rather than oblique. This ``oblique effect'' has been confirmed in numerous behavioral studies in humans and to some extent in animals. However, investigations of its neural basis have produced mixed and inconclusive results, presumably due in part to limited sample sizes. We have used a database to analyze a population of 4,418 cells in the cat's striate cortex to determine possible differences as a function of orientation. We find that both the numbers of cells and the widths of orientation tuning vary as a function of preferred orientation. Specifically, more cells prefer horizontal and vertical orientations compared with oblique angles. The largest population of cells is activated by orientations close to horizontal. In addition, orientation tuning widths are most narrow for cells preferring horizontal orientations. These findings are most prominent for simple cells tuned to high spatial frequencies. Complex cells and simple cells tuned to low spatial frequencies do not exhibit these anisotropies. For a subset of simple cells from our population (n = 104), we examined the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in shaping orientation tuning curves. We find that linear contributions alone do not account for the narrower tuning widths at horizontal orientations. By modeling simple cells as linear filters followed by static expansive nonlinearities, our analysis indicates that horizontally tuned cells have a greater nonlinear component than those tuned to other orientations. This suggests that intracortical mechanisms play a major role in shaping the oblique effect.},

  abstract = {Objective
Examination of the EEG photic driving coherence during intermittent photic stimulation in autistic patients with relatively intact verbal and intellectual functions in order to enhance the likely latent interhemispheric asymmetry in neural connectivity.
Methods
Fourteen autistic boys, aged 6\textendash{}14 years, free of drug treatment, with I.Q. 91.4 $\pm$ 22.8, and 19 normally developing boys were subject to stimulation of 12 fixed frequencies of 3\textendash{}27 Hz. The number of high coherent connections (HCC) (coherence \&gt;0.6\textendash{}0.8) was estimated among 7 leads in each hemisphere.
Results
In contrast to the spectral characteristics showing the right hemisphere deficit in the photic driving reactivity, the number of HCC differentiated the groups only in the left hemisphere where it was higher in autistics at the EEG frequencies corresponding to those of stimulation at 6\textendash{}27 Hz without asymmetry at other frequencies, the left-side prevalence increasing with frequency. No asymmetry was observed in the resting state.
Conclusions
Spectral and coherence characteristics of the EEG photic driving show different aspects of latent abnormal interhemispheric asymmetry in autistics: the right hemisphere ``hyporeactivity'' and potential ``hyperconectivity'' of likely compensatory nature in the left hemisphere.
Significance
The EEG photic driving can reveal functional topographic alterations not present in the spontaneous EEG.},

People with ASD show a robust bias towards detailed information at the expense of global information, although the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. To address this issue, we investigated the functional field of view in a group of high-functioning children with autism (n = 13) and a paired non-ASD group (n = 13). Our results indicate that the ability to correctly detect and identify stimuli sharply decreases with greater eccentricity from the fovea in people with ASD. Accordingly, a probe analysis revealed that the functional field of view in the ASD group was only about 6.62$^\circ$ of retinal eccentricity, compared with 8.57$^\circ$ in typically developing children. Thus, children with ASD appear to have a narrower functional field of view. These results challenge the conventional hypothesis that the deficit in global processing in individuals with ASD is solely due to weak central coherence. Alternatively, our data suggest that a narrower functional field of view may also contribute to this bias.},

Intracellular recording techniques were used to characterize monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and currents (IPSCs) in rat hippocampal slices and to study the mechanism of paired-pulse depression of these synaptic responses. This was achieved by stimulation in stratum radiatum close (less than 0.5 mm) to an intracellularly recorded CA1 neurone after pharmacological blockade of all excitatory synaptic transmission. 2. Under these conditions, low-frequency stimulation (0.033 Hz) evoked a pure biphasic IPSP, which had a short and constant latency to onset. This IPSP was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) suggesting that it resulted from the electrical stimulation of the axons and/or cell bodies of a monosynaptic inhibitory pathway. 3. Picrotoxin (100 microM) abolished the early component of the biphasic IPSP/C. It left an intact, pure late IPSP/C (IPSP/CB) which had a latency to onset of 29 +/- 2 ms, latency to peak of 139 +/- 4 ms, a duration of 723 +/- 135 (range 390-1730) ms and a reversal potential of -93 +/- 2 mV. The duration was highly dependent on the stimulus intensity whereas the latency to onset was largely independent of the stimulus intensity. The IPSP/CB was reduced or abolished by 1 mM-phaclofen. 4. Phaclofen (1 mM) and 2-hydroxy-saclofen (0.1-1.0 mM) reversibly depressed (60-100\%) the late component of the biphasic IPSP/C and, where maximally effective, left a pure, early IPSP/C (IPSP/CA). The IPSP/CA had a latency to onset of 3 ms or less, a latency to peak of 17 +/- 1 ms, a duration of 225 +/- 3 ms and a reversal potential of -75 +/- 2 mV. 5. Two shocks of identical strength were applied in close succession to characterize, and to study the mechanisms underlying, frequency-dependent depression of inhibitory synaptic responses. Paired-pulse depression was seen for both phases of the biphasic IPSP/C and of the pure IPSP/CB, recorded in the presence of picrotoxin. Paired-pulse depression was not accompanied by changes in the reversal potential of either component, indicating that it was caused by a reduction in the two synaptic conductances. Paired-pulse depression was greater when high stimulus intensities were employed. 6. Paired stimuli were applied at separation intervals of between 5 ms and 10 s to determine the temporal profile of frequency-dependent depression. Paired-pulse depression of both IPSCA and IPSCB was most pronounced at an interstimulus interval of 100-125 ms and ceased to occur at intervals greater than 5 10s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The concept of "autism" in the cognitive life of individuals has implications for the fields of clinical and experimental psychology. Although the evidence from clinical cases is more dramatic than the evidence from experimental research, the two sets of data are in no wise contradictory. Each tends to supplement the other, and we can understand the concept of "autism" only by looking at what clinicians have had to report and at the results of experiments in the laboratory. Our approach in this book has been to rely heavily upon evidence obtained in the laboratory. But there are glaring inadequacies in almost all experimental studies; e.g., the drives, motivations, rewards, affects, etc., that we can manipulate in the laboratory are in general far less intense and varied than the ones in everyday life. In general, this chapter is an attempt to integrate clinical and experimental conceptions of autism. We shall not attempt to cover the manifold related issues, such as how autism fits into a fuller conception of personality or the role autism plays in a general theory of cognitive functioning. We are concerned mainly with directly examining its role in perception and perceptual learning.},

  abstract = {Objective
The relationship between sex/gender differences and autism has attracted a variety of research ranging from clinical and neurobiological to etiological, stimulated by the male bias in autism prevalence. Findings are complex and do not always relate to each other in a straightforward manner. Distinct but interlinked questions on the relationship between sex/gender differences and autism remain underaddressed. To better understand the implications from existing research and to help design future studies, we propose a 4-level conceptual framework to clarify the embedded themes.
Method
We searched PubMed for publications before September 2014 using search terms ```sex OR gender OR females' AND autism.'' A total of 1,906 articles were screened for relevance, along with publications identified via additional literature reviews, resulting in 329 articles that were reviewed.
Results
Level 1, ``Nosological and diagnostic challenges,'' concerns the question, ``How should autism be defined and diagnosed in males and females?'' Level 2, ``Sex/gender-independent and sex/gender-dependent characteristics,'' addresses the question, ``What are the similarities and differences between males and females with autism?'' Level 3, ``General models of etiology: liability and threshold,'' asks the question, ``How is the liability for developing autism linked to sex/gender?'' Level 4, ``Specific etiological\textendash{}developmental mechanisms,'' focuses on the question, ``What etiological\textendash{}developmental mechanisms of autism are implicated by sex/gender and/or sexual/gender differentiation?''
Conclusions
Using this conceptual framework, findings can be more clearly summarized, and the implications of the links between findings from different levels can become clearer. Based on this 4-level framework, we suggest future research directions, methodology, and specific topics in sex/gender differences and autism.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Li and Atick (1994) presented a theory of efficient binocular encoding in which the two eyes' signals are combined using separately adaptable binocular summation and differencing channels. We designed a dichoptic test stimulus for which the summation channel sees a grating tilted in one direction (clockwise or anticlockwise of horizontal), and the differencing channel sees a grating tilted in the opposite direction. The observer's perceived direction of tilt (summation or difference direction) should depend on the relative sensitivities of the two channels. We manipulated channel sensitivity using adaptation. In correlated adaptation, each eye received the same image, which selectively adapted the summation channel; in anticorrelated adaptation, each eye received the photographic negative of the other eye's image, which selectively adapted the differencing channel. These adaptation stimuli had equal energy at all orientations. Despite being isotropic, the adaptors influenced perceived tilt: The test stimulus usually appeared tilted in the difference direction after correlated adaptation, and usually appeared tilted in the summation direction after anticorrelated adaptation. This counterintuitive finding of a tilt aftereffect from isotropic adaptors is analogous to May, Zhaoping and Hibbard's (2012) finding of a motion aftereffect from static adaptors. These two results strongly support Li and Atick's theory.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry properties for contrast-modulated (CM) gratings were examined to gain insight into their locus of processing. Two orthogonally orientated gratings were presented, one to each eye. Perceptual change rates, proportions of exclusivity and mixed percepts, and mean durations were calculated. Stimuli were noiseless luminance-defined (L), luminance-modulated noise (LM) and contrast-modulated noise (CM) gratings with sizes of 1, 2 and 4 deg and spatial frequencies of 4, 2 and 1 c/deg, respectively. For the LM and CM gratings, binary noise was fully correlated between eyes. Maximum producible modulations were used (1.0 for CM, 0.78 for LM and 0.98 for L stimuli). In a control experiment, contrasts of LM gratings were reduced until the multiples over detection threshold were similar to those of CM stimuli. Trial durations of 120 s were analyzed. Exclusive visibility decreased with increasing stimulus size regardless of the stimulus type. Even with visibilities at similar multiples above detection threshold, significantly lower proportions of exclusive percepts and perceptual changes were found for CM, compared to LM gratings. The results obtained with dichoptically presented orthogonal CM gratings are significantly different from those obtained for orthogonal gratings presented to one eye. CM stimuli therefore do engage in binocular rivalry but with different characteristics to those found for LM stimuli. These results suggest that CM stimuli are processed by a mechanism that promotes binocular combination rather than rivalry, and therefore may involve cells in a higher visual area than those that initially process LM information.},

  abstract = {The spatial analysis of a target may be strongly degraded by the simultaneous presentation of nearby pattern elements. The present study investigated the shape and extent of the region of interaction as a function of retinal location. The stimuli consisted of 3 collinear Ts which were randomly oriented up (T) or down ($\perp$). The task was to discriminate the orientation of the middle T. The retinal locations studied were at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10$^\circ$, on the lower vertical meridian and on the nasal halves of both the horizontal and the 45$^\circ$ diagonal visual field meridians. The extent of the interaction region was defined as the separation between the midpoint of two adjacent Ts that resulted in 75\% correct discrimination. The shape of the interaction region was determined by using several orientations (horizontal, vertical, left diagonal and right diagonal) for the virtual line joining the 3 Ts. Our results show that the size of the interaction regions varies linearly with eccentricity as does the size of a just resolved individual T. However, the size of the interaction region varies much more rapidly than does the resolution threshold for an individual T. The spatial interaction zones appear to be elongated radially, so that they have an elliptical shape. The size of the major axis is about 2\textendash{}3 times the size of the minor axis. The major axis is along the meridian through the central visual field (i.e. it is oriented radially) while the minor axis is oriented tangentially (i.e. isoeccentrically).},

The ON pathway drives inhibitory inputs onto some OFF ganglion cells, such that these neurons show ``push-pull'' convergence of OFF-excitation and ON-disinhibition. In this study we measure the spatial receptive field of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to OFF-sustained (OFF-S) retinal ganglion cells of mouse, establish how contrast adaptation modulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and show the pharmacology of the inhibitory inputs. We find that the spatial tuning properties of excitatory and inhibitory inputs are sufficient to determine the spatial profile of the spike output and that high spatial acuity may be particularly reliant on disinhibitory circuits. Contrast adaptation reduced excitation to OFF-S ganglion cells, as expected, and also unmasked an asymmetry in inhibitory inputs: disinhibition at light-off was immune to contrast adaptation, but inhibition at light-on was substantially reduced. In pharmacological experiments we confirm that inhibitory inputs are partly mediated by glycine, but our measurements also suggest a substantial role for GABA. Our observations therefore reveal functional diversity in the inhibitory inputs to OFF ganglion cells and suggest that in addition to enhancing operational range these inputs help shape the spatial receptive fields of ganglion cells.},

  abstract = {Cannabis was extensively used as a medicine throughout the developed world in the nineteenth century but went into decline early in the twentieth century ahead of its emergence as the most widely used illicit recreational drug later that century. Recent advances in cannabinoid pharmacology alongside the discovery of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) have re-ignited interest in cannabis-based medicines. The ECS has emerged as an important physiological system and plausible target for new medicines. Its receptors and endogenous ligands play a vital modulatory role in diverse functions including immune response, food intake, cognition, emotion, perception, behavioural reinforcement, motor co-ordination, body temperature, wake/sleep cycle, bone formation and resorption, and various aspects of hormonal control. In disease it may act as part of the physiological response or as a component of the underlying pathology. In the forefront of clinical research are the cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, and their contrasting pharmacology will be briefly outlined. The therapeutic potential and possible risks of drugs that inhibit the ECS will also be considered. This paper will then go on to review clinical research exploring the potential of cannabinoid medicines in the following indications: symptomatic relief in multiple sclerosis, chronic neuropathic pain, intractable nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and weight in the context of cancer or AIDS, psychosis, epilepsy, addiction, and metabolic disorders.

  abstract = {It is unclear what neural processes induce individual differences in perceptual organization in different modalities. To examine this issue, the present study used different forms of bistable perception: auditory streaming, verbal transformations, visual plaids, and reversible figures. We performed factor analyses on the number of perceptual switches in the tasks. A 3-factor model provided a better fit to the data than the other possible models. These factors, namely the ``auditory,'' ``shape,'' and ``motion'' factors, were separable but correlated with each other. We compared the number of perceptual switches among genotype groups to identify the effects of neurotransmitter functions on the factors. We focused on polymorphisms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met and serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) -1438G/A genes, which are involved in the modulation of dopamine and serotonin, respectively. The number of perceptual switches in auditory streaming and verbal transformations differed among COMT genotype groups, whereas that in reversible figures differed among HTR2A genotype groups. The results indicate that the auditory and shape factors reflect the functions of the dopamine and serotonin systems, respectively. Our findings suggest that the formation and selection of percepts involve neural processes in cortical and subcortical areas.},

  abstract = {Visual crowding is the difficulty in perceiving a target in the presence of nearby flankers. Most neurophysiological studies of crowding employed functional neuroimaging, but because of its low temporal resolution, no definitive answer can be given to the question: is crowding arising at the earliest or at later stages of visual processing? Here, we used a classic letters crowding paradigm in combination with electroencephalography (EEG). We manipulated the critical space between peripheral target and flankers, while ensuring a proper control of basic stimulus characteristics. Analyses were focused on event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity in the alpha (8\textendash{}12~Hz), beta (15\textendash{}30~Hz) and gamma (30\textendash{}80~Hz) bands. At the ERP level, we found that the first sign of a crowding-induced modulation of EEG activity was a suppression of the N1 component. Oscillatory analysis revealed an early stimulus-evoked gamma enhancement and a later alpha reduction that, however, were not influenced by the amount of crowding. Importantly, reduction in the beta band reflected the amount of crowding (i.e., stronger reduction for strong relative to mid crowding condition) and correlated with individual behavioral performance. Collectively, these findings show that crowding for complex objects emerges at later stages of visual processing, possibly as a result of large-scale network interaction.},

  abstract = {Autism and schizophrenia share multiple phenotypic and genotypic markers, and there is ongoing debate regarding the relationship of these two disorders. To examine whether cortical dynamics are similar across these disorders, we directly compared fMRI responses to visual, somatosensory and auditory stimuli in adults with autism (N = 15), with schizophrenia (N = 15), and matched controls (N = 15). All participants completed a one-back letter detection task presented at fixation (to control attention) while task-irrelevant sensory stimulation was delivered to the different modalities. We focused specifically on the response amplitudes and the variability in sensory fMRI responses of the two groups, given the evidence of greater trial-to-trial variability in adults with autism. Both autism and schizophrenia individuals showed weaker signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in sensory-evoked responses compared to controls (d \&gt; 0.42), but for different reasons. For the autism group, the fMRI response amplitudes were indistinguishable from controls but were more variable trial-to-trial (d = 0.47). For the schizophrenia group, response amplitudes were smaller compared to autism (d = 0.44) and control groups (d = 0.74), but were not significantly more variable (d \&lt; 0.29). These differential group profiles suggest (1) that greater trial-to-trial variability in cortical responses may be specific to autism and is not a defining characteristic of schizophrenia, and (2) that blunted response amplitudes may be characteristic of schizophrenia. The relationship between the amplitude and the variability of cortical activity might serve as a specific signature differentiating these neurodevelopmental disorders. Identifying the neural basis of these responses and their relationship to the underlying genetic bases may substantially enlighten the understanding of both disorders.},

  abstract = {Auditory stream segregation is an important paradigm in the study of auditory scene analysis. Performance-based measures of auditory stream segregation have received increasing use as a complement to subjective reports of streaming. For example, the sensitivity in discriminating a temporal shift imposed on one B tone in an ABA sequence consisting of A and B tones that differ in frequency is often used to infer the perceptual organization (one stream vs. two streams). Limitations of these measures are discussed here, and an alternative measure based on the combination of decision weights and sensitivity is suggested. In the experiment, for ABA and ABB sequences varying in tempo (fast/slow) and duration (long/short), the sensitivity (d') in the temporal shift discrimination task did not differ between fast and slow sequences, despite strong differences in perceptual organization. The decision weights assigned to within-stream and between-stream interonset intervals also deviated from the idealized pattern of near-exclusive reliance on between-stream information in the subjectively integrated case, and on within-stream information in the subjectively segregated case. However, an estimate of internal noise computed using a combination of the estimated decision weights and sensitivity differentiated between sequences that were predominantly perceived as integrated or segregated, with significantly higher internal noise estimates for the segregated case. Therefore, the method of using a combination of decision weights and sensitivity provides a measure of auditory stream segregation that overcomes some of the limitations of purely sensitivity-based measures.

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that is not traditionally considered to affect the visual system. However, recent findings have reported decreased cortical levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in occipital cortex. To explore possible functional consequences of MDD on visual processing, we applied a psychophysical visual motion processing task in which healthy young adults typically exhibit impaired perceptual discrimination of large high-contrast stimuli. It has been suggested that this phenomenon, spatial suppression, is mediated by GABAergic center\textendash{}surround antagonism in visual pathways. Based on previous findings linking MDD to occipital GABA dysfunction, we hypothesized that MDD patients would exhibit decreased spatial suppression, leading to the counterintuitive hypothesis of better psychophysical performance. Indeed, motion perception for typically suppressed stimuli was enhanced in patients with MDD compared with age-matched controls. Furthermore, the degree of spatial suppression correlated with an individual's illness load; patients with greater lifetime duration of depression exhibited the least spatial suppression and performed the best in the high-contrast motion discrimination task. Notably, this decrease in spatial suppression persisted beyond recovery and without the confound of acute illness or treatment; all patients had been clinically recovered and unmedicated for several months at the time of testing, suggesting that depression has ubiquitous consequences that may persist long after mood symptoms have receded. This finding raises the possibility that spatial suppression may represent a sensitive endophenotypic marker of trait vulnerability in MDD.},

They turn a steering wheel to make two-alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination, and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires the visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. This stimulation elicits larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.},

One important psychophysical task that has illuminated many of these principles and mechanisms is the ``streaming'' task. Despite the wide use of this task to study psychophysical mechanisms of human audition, no studies have explicitly tested the streaming abilities of non-human animals using the standard methodologies employed in human-audition studies. Here, we trained rhesus macaques to participate in the streaming task using methodologies and controls similar to those presented in previous human studies. Overall, we found that the monkeys' behavioral reports were qualitatively consistent with those of human listeners, thus suggesting that this task may be a valuable tool for future neurophysiological studies.},

  abstract = {Purpose:

To evaluate an alternative method for generating multibanded radiofrequency (RF) pulses for use in multiband slice-accelerated imaging with slice-GRAPPA unaliasing, substantially reducing the required peak power without bandwidth compromises. This allows much higher accelerations for spin-echo methods such as SE-fMRI and diffusion-weighted MRI where multibanded slice acceleration has been limited by available peak power.

Theory and Methods:

Multibanded ``time-shifted'' RF pulses were generated by inserting temporal shifts between the applications of RF energy for individual bands, avoiding worst-case constructive interferences. Slice profiles and images in phantoms and human subjects were acquired at 3 T.

Results:

For typical sinc pulses, time-shifted multibanded RF pulses were generated with little increase in required peak power compared to single-banded pulses. Slice profile quality was improved by allowing for higher pulse bandwidths, and image quality was improved by allowing for optimum flip angles to be achieved.

Conclusion:

A simple approach has been demonstrated that significantly alleviates the restrictions imposed on achievable slice acceleration factors in multiband spin-echo imaging due to the power requirements of multibanded RF pulses. This solution will allow for increased accelerations in diffusion-weighted MRI applications where data acquisition times are normally very long and the ability to accelerate is extremely valuable.

In consideration of the experimental constraints on the statistics of the alternations (mean and shape of the dominance duration distribution and correlations between successive durations) we ask whether we can rule out one of the mechanisms.

  doi = {10.1016/S0378-5955(00)00224-0},
  abstract = {An important feature of auditory scene analysis is the perceptual organization of sequential sound components, or `auditory stream segregation'. Auditory stream segregation can be demonstrated by presenting a sequence of high and low frequency tones in an alternating pattern, ABAB. When the tone presentation rate (PR) is slow or the frequency separation ($\Delta$F) between the tones is small (\&lt;10\%), a connected alternating sequence ABAB is perceived. When the PR is fast or the $\Delta$F is large, however, the alternating sequence perceptually splits into two parallel auditory streams, one composed of interrupted `A' tones, and the other of interrupted `B' tones. The neurophysiological basis of this perceptual phenomenon is unknown. Neural correlates of auditory stream segregation were examined in A1 of the awake monkey using neuronal ensemble techniques (multiunit activity and current source density). Responses evoked by alternating frequency sequences of tones, ABAB, were studied as a function of PR (5, 10, 20 and 40 Hz). `A' tones corresponded to the best frequency (BF) of the cortical site, while `B' tones were situated away from the BF by an amount $\Delta$F. At slow PRs, `A' and `B' tones evoked responses that generated an overall pattern of activity at the stimulus PR. In contrast, at fast PRs, `B' tone responses were differentially suppressed, resulting in a pattern of activity consisting predominantly of `A' tone responses at half the PR. The magnitude of `B' tone response suppression increased with $\Delta$F. Differential suppression of BF and non-BF tone responses at high PRs can be explained by physiological principles of forward masking. The effect of $\Delta$F is explained by the hypothesis that responses to tones distant from the BF are more susceptible to suppression by BF tones than responses to tones near the BF. These results parallel human psychoacoustics of auditory stream segregation and suggest a cortical basis for the perceptual phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Auditory streaming and visual plaids have been used extensively to study perceptual organization in each modality. Both stimuli can produce bistable alternations between grouped (one object) and split (two objects) interpretations. They also share two peculiar features: (i) at the onset of stimulus presentation, organization starts with a systematic bias towards the grouped interpretation; (ii) this first percept has `inertia'; it lasts longer than the subsequent ones. As a result, the probability of forming different objects builds up over time, a landmark of both behavioural and neurophysiological data on auditory streaming. Here we show that first percept bias and inertia are independent. In plaid perception, inertia is due to a depth ordering ambiguity in the transparent (split) interpretation that makes plaid perception tristable rather than bistable: experimental manipulations removing the depth ambiguity suppressed inertia. However, the first percept bias persisted. We attempted a similar manipulation for auditory streaming by introducing level differences between streams, to bias which stream would appear in the perceptual foreground. Here both inertia and first percept bias persisted. We thus argue that the critical common feature of the onset of perceptual organization is the grouping bias, which may be related to the transition from temporally/spatially local to temporally/spatially global computation.},

  issn = {0010-9452},
  doi = {10.1016/j.cortex.2015.11.025},
  abstract = {Discrimination of facial identities is a fundamental function of the human brain that is challenging to examine with macroscopic measurements of neural activity, such as those obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Although visual adaptation or repetition suppression (RS) stimulation paradigms have been successfully implemented to this end with such recording techniques, objective evidence of an identity-specific discrimination response due to adaptation at the level of the visual representation is lacking. Here, we addressed this issue with fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) and EEG recording combined with a symmetry/asymmetry adaptation paradigm. Adaptation to one facial identity is induced through repeated presentation of that identity at a rate of 6 images per second (6~Hz) over 10~sec. Subsequently, this identity is presented in alternation with another facial identity (i.e., its anti-face, both faces being equidistant from an average face), producing an identity repetition rate of 3~Hz over a 20~sec testing sequence. A clear EEG response at 3~Hz is observed over the right occipito-temporal (ROT) cortex, indexing discrimination between the two facial identities in the absence of an explicit behavioral discrimination measure. This face identity discrimination occurs immediately after adaptation and disappears rapidly within 20~sec. Importantly, this 3~Hz response is not observed in a control condition without the single-identity 10~sec adaptation period. These results indicate that visual adaptation to a given facial identity produces an objective (i.e., at a pre-defined stimulation frequency) electrophysiological index of visual discrimination between that identity and another, and provides a unique behavior-free quantification of the effect of visual adaptation.},

  abstract = {Background
Systemic inflammation impairs brain function and is increasingly implicated in the etiology of common mental illnesses, particularly depression and Alzheimer's disease. Immunotherapies selectively targeting proinflammatory cytokines demonstrate efficacy in a subset of patients with depression. However, efforts to identify patients most vulnerable to the central effects of inflammation are hindered by insensitivity of conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging.
Methods
We used quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging, a magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables quantification of changes in brain macromolecular density, together with experimentally induced inflammation to investigate effects of systemic inflammatory challenge on human brain microstructure. Imaging with qMT was performed in 20 healthy participants after typhoid vaccination and saline control injection. An additional 20 participants underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography following the same inflammatory challenge.
Results
The qMT data demonstrated that inflammation induced a rapid change in brain microstructure, reflected in increased magnetization exchange from free (water) to macromolecular-bound protons, within a discrete region of insular cortex implicated in representing internal physiologic states including inflammation. The functional significance of this change in insular microstructure was demonstrated by correlation with inflammation-induced fatigue and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging, which revealed increased resting glucose metabolism within this region following the same inflammatory challenge.
Conclusions
Together these observations highlight a novel structural biomarker of the central physiologic and behavioral effects of mild systemic inflammation. The widespread clinical availability of magnetic resonance imaging supports the viability of qMT imaging as a clinical biomarker in trials of immunotherapeutics, both to identify patients vulnerable to the effects of systemic inflammation and to monitor neurobiological responses.},

In visual motion, this is evident as antagonistic interactions between centre and surround regions of the receptive fields of many direction-selective neurons in visual cortex. In a series of psychophysical experiments we make the counterintuitive observation that increasing the size of a high-contrast moving pattern renders its direction of motion more difficult to perceive and reduces its effectiveness as an adaptation stimulus. We propose that this is a perceptual correlate of centre\textendash{}surround antagonism, possibly within a population of neurons in the middle temporal visual area. The spatial antagonism of motion signals observed at high contrast gives way to spatial summation as contrast decreases. Evidently, integration of motion signals over space depends crucially on the visibility of those signals, thereby allowing the visual system to register motion information efficiently and adaptively.},

The persistence of ADHD is associated with considerable liability to neuropsychiatric co-morbidity such as depression, anxiety and substance use disorder. The substantial heritability of ADHD is well documented and recent genome-wide analyses for risk genes revealed synaptic adhesion molecules (e.g. latrophilin-3, LPHN3; fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein-3, FLRT3), glutamate receptors (e.g. metabotropic glutamate receptor-5, GRM5) and mediators of intracellular signalling pathways (e.g. nitric oxide synthase-1, NOS1). These genes encode principal components of the molecular machinery that connects pre- and postsynaptic neurons, facilitates glutamatergic transmission, controls synaptic plasticity and empowers intersecting neural circuits to process and refine information. Thus, identification of genetic variation affecting molecules essential for the formation, specification and function of excitatory synapses is refocusing research efforts on ADHD pathogenesis to include the long-neglected glutamate system.},

We review the body of literature addressing this divide and conclude that in fact both sides are correct\textemdash{}depending on the form of bistable perception being considered. Converging evidence suggests that visual attention is required for alternations in the type of bistable perception called binocular rivalry, while alternations during other types of bistable perception appear to continue without requiring attention.

By contrast, in rodents such as mice and rats, the dLGN is not overtly laminated, the retinal terminals from the two eyes are only partially segregated [ 3, 4 ], and many cells in the binocular segment of dLGN get excitatory inputs from both eyes [ 5, 6 ]. Here, we show that the evolutionary ancient koniocellular (K) division of primate dLGN, like rodent dLGN, forms a subcortical site of binocular integration. We recorded single-cell activity in dLGN of anesthetized marmoset monkeys. As expected, cells in the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) layers received monocular excitatory inputs. By contrast, many cells in the K layers received excitatory inputs from both eyes. The specialized properties of distinct K sub-populations (for example, blue-yellow color selectivity) were preserved across the two eye inputs, and where tested, the contrast sensitivity of each eye input was roughly matched. The results argue that evolutionarily widely separated orders such as rodents and primates have a shared strategy of integrating signals from the two eyes in subcortical circuits.},

The selective GABAB receptor agonist R-baclofen previously reversed social deficits and reduced repetitive behaviors in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, and Arbaclofen improved some clinical symptoms in some Fragile X and ASD patients. To evaluate R-baclofen in a broader range of mouse models of ASD, we tested both the R-baclofen enantiomer and the less potent S-baclofen enantiomer in two inbred strains of mice that display low sociability and/or high repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. R-baclofen treatment reversed social approach deficits in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR), reduced repetitive self-grooming and high marble burying scores in BTBR, and reduced stereotyped jumping in C58/J (C58), at nonsedating doses. S-baclofen produced minimal effects at the same doses. These findings encourage investigations of R-baclofen in other preclinical model systems. Additional clinical studies may be warranted to further evaluate the hypothesis that the GABAB receptor represents a promising pharmacological target for treating appropriately stratified subsets of individuals with ASD.},

We find common dynamical behavior in several models of this general type, which differ in their architecture in the form of their gain functions, and in how they implement the slow process that underlies alternating dominance. We focus on examining the effect of the input strength on the rate (and existence) of oscillations. In spite of their differences, all considered models possess similar qualitative features, some of which we report here for the first time. Experimentally, dominance durations have been reported to decrease monotonically with increasing stimulus strength (such as Levelt's ``Proposition IV''). The models predict this behavior; however, they also predict that at a lower range of input strength dominance durations increase with increasing stimulus strength. The nonmonotonic dependency of duration on stimulus strength is common to both deterministic and stochastic models. We conclude that additional experimental tests of Levelt's Proposition IV are needed to reconcile models and perception.},

  abstract = {The mouse is becoming a key species for research on the neural circuits of the early visual system. To relate such circuits to perception, one must measure visually guided behavior and ask how it depends on fundamental stimulus attributes such as visual contrast. Using operant conditioning, we trained mice to detect visual contrast in a two-alternative forced-choice task. After 3\textendash{}4 weeks of training, mice performed hundreds of trials in each session. Numerous sessions yielded high-quality psychometric curves from which we inferred measures of contrast sensitivity. In multiple sessions, however, choices were influenced not only by contrast, but also by estimates of reward value and by irrelevant factors such as recent failures and rewards. This behavior was captured by a generalized linear model involving not only the visual responses to the current stimulus but also a bias term and history terms depending on the outcome of the previous trial. We compared the behavioral performance of the mice to predictions of a simple decoder applied to neural responses measured in primary visual cortex of awake mice during passive viewing. The decoder performed better than the animal, suggesting that mice might not use optimally the information contained in the activity of visual cortex.},

With a standard 32-channel receiver coil at 3 T, we demonstrate that slice acceleration factors of up to eight (MB = 8) with blipped controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI), in the absence of in-plane accelerations, can be used routinely with acceptable image quality and integrity for whole brain imaging. Spectral analyses of single-shot fMRI time series demonstrate that temporal fluctuations due to both neuronal and physiological sources were distinguishable and comparable up to slice-acceleration factors of nine (MB = 9). The increased temporal efficiency could be employed to achieve, within a given acquisition period, higher spatial resolution, increased fMRI statistical power, multiple TEs, faster sampling of temporal events in a resting state fMRI time series, increased sampling of q-space in diffusion imaging, or more quiet time during a scan.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

  abstract = {Ambiguous visual stimuli elicit different perceptual interpretations over time, creating the illusion that a constant stimulus is changing. We investigate whether such spontaneous changes in visual perception involve occipital brain regions specialized for processing visual information, despite the absence of concomitant changes in stimulation. Spontaneous perceptual changes observed while viewing a binocular rivalry stimulus or an ambiguous structure-from-motion stimulus were compared with stimulus-induced perceptual changes that occurred in response to an actual stimulus change. Intracranial recordings from human occipital cortex revealed that spontaneous and stimulus-induced perceptual changes were both associated with an early transient increase in high-frequency power that was more spatially confined than a later transient decrease in low-frequency power. We suggest that the observed high-frequency and low-frequency modulations relate to initiation and maintenance of a percept, respectively. Our results are compatible with the idea that spontaneous changes in perception originate from competitive interactions within visual neural networks.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ambiguous visual stimuli elicit different perceptual interpretations over time, creating the illusion that a constant stimulus is changing. The literature on the neural correlates of conscious visual perception remains inconclusive regarding the extent to which such spontaneous changes in perception involve sensory brain regions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between existing animal and human studies, we recorded from intracranial electrodes placed on the human occipital lobe. We compared two different kinds of ambiguous stimuli, binocular rivalry and the phenomenon of ambiguous structure-from-motion, enabling generalization of our findings across different stimuli. Our results indicate that spontaneous and stimulus-induced changes in perception (i.e., ``illusory'' and ``real'' changes in the stimulus, respectively) may involve sensory regions to a similar extent.},

  doi = {10.1002/mrm.24898},
  abstract = {Purpose

Controlled aliasing techniques for simultaneously acquired echo-planar imaging slices have been shown to significantly increase the temporal efficiency for both diffusion-weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The ``slice-GRAPPA'' (SG) method has been widely used to reconstruct such data. We investigate robust optimization techniques for SG to ensure image reconstruction accuracy through a reduction of leakage artifacts.

Methods

Split SG is proposed as an alternative kernel optimization method. The performance of Split SG is compared to standard SG using data collected on a spherical phantom and in vivo on two subjects at 3 T. Slice-accelerated and nonaccelerated data were collected for a spin-echo diffusion-weighted acquisition. Signal leakage metrics and time-series SNR were used to quantify the performance of the kernel fitting approaches.

Results

The Split SG optimization strategy significantly reduces leakage artifacts for both phantom and in vivo acquisitions. In addition, a significant boost in time-series SNR for in vivo diffusion-weighted acquisitions with in-plane
2\texttimes{} and slice
3\texttimes{} accelerations was observed with the Split SG approach.

Conclusion

By minimizing the influence of leakage artifacts during the training of SG kernels, we have significantly improved reconstruction accuracy. Our robust kernel fitting strategy should enable better reconstruction accuracy and higher slice-acceleration across many applications.

  title = {Estimating Inter-Observer Variability in {{GABA}}-Ergic Suppression},
  abstract = {Individual differences in response to visual contrast are typically observed in the amount of (i) saturation of responses at high contrast levels and (ii) suppression by cross-channel masking. A potential mechanism that underlies these processes is GABA-ergic inhibition, as GABA antagonists eliminate both effects in single neurons (e.g. Morrone, Burr \& Speed, 1987). However, these two properties of contrast transduction have not been directly compared within the human population. We measured steady-state EEG responses to patches of sine-wave grating s (0.5c/deg) flickering at 7Hz in 100 subjects at seven contrast levels (0-64\%). In some conditions a high contrast (32\%) orthogonal mask flickering at 5Hz was superimposed on the target stimuli. We calculated a saturation index, defined as the ratio of amplitudes at the two highest target contrast levels. To quantify masking, we took the ratio of amplitudes when the mask was present versus absent, averaged across intermediate contrast levels. We found a highly significant correlation between masking and saturation across observers (r = 0.50, p $<$ .001), such that individuals who exhibited substantial masking also displayed strong saturation. This suggests a common underlying mechanism, most likely GABA-ergic inhibition, that varies widely in the population and therefore may have clinical relevance.},

Recent work on vision, and other sensory modalities, has shown that this description has substantial shortcomings. Here we review our emerging understanding of how adaptation alters the balance between excitatory and suppressive signals, how effects depend on adaptation duration, and how adaptation influences representations that are distributed within and across multiple brain structures.

In visual motion, this is evident as antagonistic interactions between centre and surround regions of the receptive fields of many direction-selective neurons in visual cortex. In a series of psychophysical experiments we make the counterintuitive observation that increasing the size of a high-contrast moving pattern renders its direction of motion more difficult to perceive and reduces its effectiveness as an adaptation stimulus. We propose that this is a perceptual correlate of centre\textendash{}surround antagonism, possibly within a population of neurons in the middle temporal visual area. The spatial antagonism of motion signals observed at high contrast gives way to spatial summation as contrast decreases. Evidently, integration of motion signals over space depends crucially on the visibility of those signals, thereby allowing the visual system to register motion information efficiently and adaptively.},

  abstract = {What is known and objective

Antiepileptic drugs often produce serious adverse effects, and many patients do not respond to them properly. Phytocannabinoids produce anticonvulsant effects in preclinical and preliminary human studies, and appear to produce fewer adverse effects than available antiepileptic drugs. The present review summarizes studies on the anticonvulsant properties of phytocannabinoids.

Methods

Literature search using the PubMed database to identify studies on phytocannabinoids and epilepsy.

Results and discussion

Preclinical studies suggest that phytocannabinoids, especially cannabidiol and cannabidivarin, have potent anticonvulsant effects which are mediated by the endocannabinoid system. Human studies are limited in number and quality, but suggest that cannabidiol has anticonvulsant effects in adult and infantile epilepsy and is well tolerated after prolonged administration.

What is new and conclusion

Phytocannabinoids produce anticonvulsant effects through the endocannabinoid system, with few adverse effects. Cannabidiol and cannabidivarin should be tested in randomized, controlled clinical trials, especially in infantile epileptic syndromes.},

While acquiring additional data to correct for these distortions alleviates the adverse effects of this artifact drastically \textendash{} e.g., by reversing the polarity of the phase-encoding (PE) direction \textendash{} this strategy is often not an option due to scan time constraints. Especially in a clinical context, where patient comfort and safety are of paramount importance, acquisition specifications are preferred that minimize scan time, typically resulting in data obtained with only one PE direction. In this work, we investigated whether choosing a different polarity of the PE direction would affect the outcome of a specific clinical research study. To address this methodological question, fractional anisotropy (FA) estimates of FreeSurfer brain regions were obtained in civilian and combat controls, remitted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, and persistent PTSD patients before and after trauma-focused therapy and were compared between diffusion MRI data sets acquired with different polarities of the PE direction (posterior-to-anterior, PA and anterior-to-posterior, AP). Our results demonstrate that regional FA estimates differ on average in the order of 5\% between AP and PA PE data. In addition, when comparing FA estimates between different subject groups for specific cingulum subdivisions, the conclusions for AP and PA PE data were not in agreement. These findings increase our understanding of how one of the most pronounced data artifacts in diffusion MRI can impact group analyses and should encourage users to be more cautious when interpreting and reporting study outcomes derived from data acquired along a single PE direction.},

CBG's anticonvulsant potential was also assessed in vivo. CBD effects on NaV channels were investigated using patch-clamp recordings from rat CA1 hippocampal neurons in brain slices, human SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma) cells and mouse cortical neurons in culture. CBG effects were also assessed in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse cortical neurons. CBD and CBG effects on veratridine-stimulated human recombinant NaV1.1, 1.2 or 1.5 channels were assessed using a membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye high-throughput assay. The effect of CBG on pentyleneterazole-induced (PTZ) seizures was assessed in rat. CBD (10 $\mu$M) blocked NaV currents in SH-SY5Y cells, mouse cortical neurons and recombinant cell lines, and affected spike parameters in rat CA1 neurons; CBD also significantly decreased membrane resistance. CBG blocked NaV to a similar degree to CBD in both SH-SY5Y and mouse recordings, but had no effect (50\textendash{}200 mg/kg) on PTZ-induced seizures in rat. CBD and CBG are NaV channel blockers at micromolar concentrations in human and murine neurons and recombinant cells. In contrast to previous reports investigating CBD, CBG had no effect upon PTZ-induced seizures in rat, indicating that NaV blockade per se does not correlate with anticonvulsant effects.},

Discriminating the direction of motion of a low-contrast pattern becomes easier with increasing stimulus area. However, increasing the size of a high-contrast pattern makes it more difficult for observers to discriminate motion. This surprising result, termed spatial suppression, is thought to be mediated by a form of center-surround suppression found throughout the visual pathway. Here, we examine the counterintuitive hypothesis that aging alters such center-surround interactions in ways that improve performance in some tasks. We found that older observers required briefer stimulus durations than did younger observers to extract information about stimulus direction in conditions using large, high-contrast patterns. We suggest that this age-related improvement in motion discrimination may be linked to reduced GABAergic functioning in the senescent brain, which reduces center-surround suppression in motion-selective neurons.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose

Epilepsy is the most prevalent neurological disease and is characterized by recurrent seizures. Here, we investigate (i) the anticonvulsant profiles of cannabis-derived botanical drug substances (BDSs) rich in cannabidivarin (CBDV) and containing cannabidiol (CBD) in acute in vivo seizure models and (ii) the binding of CBDV BDSs and their components at cannabinoid CB1 receptors.

Experimental Approach

The anticonvulsant profiles of two CBDV BDSs (50\textendash{}422\,mg$\cdot$kg-1) were evaluated in three animal models of acute seizure. Purified CBDV and CBD were also evaluated in an isobolographic study to evaluate potential pharmacological interactions. CBDV BDS effects on motor function were also investigated using static beam and grip strength assays. Binding of CBDV BDSs to cannabinoid CB1 receptors was evaluated using displacement binding assays.

Key Results

CBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in the pentylenetetrazole ($\geq$100\,mg$\cdot$kg-1) and audiogenic seizure models ($\geq$87\,mg$\cdot$kg-1), and suppressed pilocarpine-induced convulsions ($\geq$100\,mg$\cdot$kg-1). The isobolographic study revealed that the anticonvulsant effects of purified CBDV and CBD were linearly additive when co-administered. Some motor effects of CBDV BDSs were observed on static beam performance; no effects on grip strength were found. The $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinol and $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabivarin content of CBDV BDS accounted for its greater affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than purified CBDV.

Conclusions and Implications

CBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in three models of seizure that were not mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and were of comparable efficacy with purified CBDV. These findings strongly support the further clinical development of CBDV BDSs for the treatment of epilepsy.},

The aim of this reveiw was to analyze the efficacy of cannabis in the treatment of epilepsy in adults and children. In addition, a description of the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in epilepsy is given in order to provide a biochemical background to the effects of endogenous cannabinoids in our body. General tolerability and adverse events associated with cannabis treatment are also investigated. Several anecdotal reports and clinical trials suggest that in the human population cannabis has anticonvulsant properties and could be effective in treating partial epilepsies and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, still known as ``grand mal.'' They are based, among other factors, on the observation that in individuals who smoke marijuana to treat epilepsy, cessation of cannabis use precipitates the re-emergence of convulsive seizures, whereas resuming consumption of this psychotropic drug controls epilepsy in a reproducible manner. In conclusion, there is some anecdotal evidence for the potential efficacy of cannabis in treating epilepsy. Though there has been an increased effort by patients with epilepsy, their caregivers, growers, and legislators to legalize various forms of cannabis, there is still concern about its efficacy, relative potency, availability of medication-grade preparations, dosing, and potential short- and long-term side effects, including those on prenatal and childhood development.},

Therefore, in order to explore the specificity of retinal contrast gain as a marker of depression in comparison with other psychiatric diseases, we recorded the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) in patients with ADHD. Twenty patients diagnosed with ADHD and 20 matched healthy subjects were studied. Visual pattern electroretinograms were recorded from both eyes. The contrast gain of the patients with attention deficit disorder (ADD) did not differ from the control group, nor did the contrast gain of any ADHD subgroup (predominantly inattentive or combined patients). In the healthy subjects, a significant correlation between depression score and contrast gain was found. As the contrast gain in an earlier study clearly separated the patients with depression from the controls, we assume that retinal contrast gain might be a specific marker in depression.},

To better understand the triggering elements of visual stimuli and cortical mechanisms of hyperexcitability, we examined eleven patients with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy by recording visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to temporally modulated patterns of different contrast. For stimuli of low-medium, but not high, temporal frequency, the contrast dependence of VEP amplitude and latency is remarkably abnormal for luminance contrast (black-white), but not so for chromatic contrast (equiluminant red-green) stimuli. We conclude that cortical mechanisms of contrast gain control for pattern stimuli of relatively low temporal frequency and high luminance contrast are lacking or severely impaired in photosensitive subjects.},

To test these proposals, we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) after local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABAA antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300\%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model in which GABAA inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABAA inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

  abstract = {Purpose

Controlled aliasing techniques for simultaneously acquired echo-planar imaging slices have been shown to significantly increase the temporal efficiency for both diffusion-weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. The ``slice-GRAPPA'' (SG) method has been widely used to reconstruct such data. We investigate robust optimization techniques for SG to ensure image reconstruction accuracy through a reduction of leakage artifacts.

Methods

Split SG is proposed as an alternative kernel optimization method. The performance of Split SG is compared to standard SG using data collected on a spherical phantom and in vivo on two subjects at 3 T. Slice-accelerated and nonaccelerated data were collected for a spin-echo diffusion-weighted acquisition. Signal leakage metrics and time-series SNR were used to quantify the performance of the kernel fitting approaches.

Results

The Split SG optimization strategy significantly reduces leakage artifacts for both phantom and in vivo acquisitions. In addition, a significant boost in time-series SNR for in vivo diffusion-weighted acquisitions with in-plane
2\texttimes{} and slice
3\texttimes{} accelerations was observed with the Split SG approach.

Conclusion

By minimizing the influence of leakage artifacts during the training of SG kernels, we have significantly improved reconstruction accuracy. Our robust kernel fitting strategy should enable better reconstruction accuracy and higher slice-acceleration across many applications.

Experiment 1 used superimposed $\pm$45$^\circ$ gratings viewed dioptically for 3 s, followed by a brief contrast increment in one of the gratings to direct exogenous attention to that grating. After a brief blank period, dichoptic stimuli were presented for various durations (100\textendash{}700 ms). Exogenous attention strongly influenced which stimulus was initially dominant in binocular rivalry, replicating an earlier report (Mitchell, Stoner, \&amp; Reynolds. (2004). Object-based attention determines dominance in binocular rivalry. Nature, 429, 410\textendash{}413). In Experiment 2, endogenous attention was manipulated by having participants track one of two oblique gratings both of which independently and continuously changed their orientations and spatial frequencies during a 5 s period. The initially dominant grating was most often the one whose orientation matched the grating correctly tracked using endogenous attention. In Experiment 3, we measured the strength of both exogenous and endogenous attention by varying the contrast of one of two rival gratings when attention was previously directed to that grating. The contrast of the attended grating had to be reduced by an amount in the neighborhood of 0.3 log-units, to counteract attention's boost to initial dominance. Evidently both exogenous and endogenous attention can influence initial dominance of binocular rivalry, effectively boosting the stimulus strength of the attended rival stimulus.},

  abstract = {The timing of perceptual decisions depends on both deterministic and stochastic factors, as the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence (deterministic) is contaminated by sensory and/or internal noise (stochastic). When human observers view multistable visual displays, successive episodes of stochastic accumulation culminate in repeated reversals of visual appearance. Treating reversal timing as a ``first-passage time'' problem, we ask how the observed timing densities constrain the underlying stochastic accumulation. Importantly, mean reversal times (i.e., deterministic factors) differ enormously between displays/observers/stimulation levels, whereas the variance and skewness of reversal times (i.e., stochastic factors) keep characteristic proportions of the mean. What sort of stochastic process could reproduce this highly consistent ``scaling property?'' Here we show that the collective activity of a finite population of bistable units (i.e., a generalized Ehrenfest process) quantitatively reproduces all aspects of the scaling property of multistable phenomena, in contrast to other processes under consideration (Poisson, Wiener, or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). The postulated units express the spontaneous dynamics of attractor assemblies transitioning between distinct activity states. Plausible candidates are cortical columns, or clusters of columns, as they are preferentially connected and spontaneously explore a restricted repertoire of activity states. Our findings suggests that perceptual representations are granular, probabilistic, and operate far from equilibrium, thereby offering a suitable substrate for statistical inference.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spontaneous reversals of high-level perception, so-called multistable perception, conform to highly consistent and characteristic statistics, constraining plausible neural representations. We show that the observed perceptual dynamics would be reproduced quantitatively by a finite population of distinct neural assemblies, each with locally bistable activity, operating far from the collective equilibrium (generalized Ehrenfest process). Such a representation would be consistent with the intrinsic stochastic dynamics of neocortical activity, which is dominated by preferentially connected assemblies, such as cortical columns or clusters of columns. We predict that local neuron assemblies will express bistable dynamics, with spontaneous active-inactive transitions, whenever they contribute to high-level perception.},

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry entails a perceptual alternation between incompatible stimuli presented to the two eyes. A minimal explanation for binocular rivalry involves strong competitive inhibition between neurons responding to different monocular stimuli to preclude simultaneous activity in the two groups. In addition, strong self-adaptation of dominant neurons is necessary to enable suppressed neurons to become dominant in turn. Here a minimal nonlinear neural model is developed incorporating inhibition, self-adaptation, and recurrent excitation. The model permits derivation of an equation for mean dominance duration as a function of the underlying physiological variables. The dominance duration equation incorporates an explicit representation of Levelt's second law. The same equation also shows that introduction of a simple compressive response nonlinearity can explain Levelt's fourth law. Finally, addition of brief, recurrent synaptic facilitation to the model generates properties of rivalry memory.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the brain network topology correlates with the cognitive function. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between functional brain networks that process sensory inputs and outputs. In this study, we focus on steady-state paradigms using a periodic visual stimulus, which are increasingly being used in both brain-computer interface (BCI) and cognitive neuroscience researches. Using the graph theoretical analysis, we investigated the relationship between the topology of functional networks entrained by periodic stimuli and steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using two frequencies and eleven subjects. First, the entire functional network (Network 0) of each frequency for each subject was constructed according to the coherence between electrode pairs. Next, Network 0 was divided into three sub-networks, in which the connection strengths were either significantly (positively for Network 1, negatively for Network 3) or non-significantly (Network 2) correlated with the SSVEP responses. Our results revealed that the SSVEP responses were positively correlated to the mean functional connectivity, clustering coefficient, and global and local efficiencies, while these responses were negatively correlated with the characteristic path length of Networks 0, 1 and 2. Furthermore, the strengths of these connections that significantly correlated with the SSVEP (both positively and negatively) were mainly found to be long-range connections between the parietal-occipital and frontal regions. These results indicate that larger SSVEP responses correspond with better functional network topology structures. This study may provide new insights for understanding brain mechanisms when using SSVEPs as frequency tags.},

  abstract = {Summary
When subjects monitor a single location, visual target detection depends on the pre-target phase of an $\sim$8~Hz brain rhythm [1, 2]. When multiple locations are monitored, performance decrements suggest a division of the 8~Hz rhythm over the number of locations [3], indicating that different locations are sequentially sampled. Indeed, when subjects monitor two locations, performance benefits alternate at a 4~Hz rhythm [4]. These performance alternations were revealed after a reset of attention to one location. Although resets are common and important events for attention [5], it is unknown whether, in the absence of resets, ongoing attention samples stimuli in alternation. Here, we examined whether spatially specific attentional sampling can be revealed by ongoing pre-target brain rhythms. Visually induced gamma-band activity plays a role in spatial attention. Therefore, we hypothesized that performance on two simultaneously monitored stimuli can be predicted by a 4~Hz modulation of gamma-band activity. Brain rhythms were assessed with magnetoencephalography (MEG) while subjects monitored bilateral grating stimuli for a unilateral target event. The corresponding contralateral gamma-band responses were subtracted from each other to isolate spatially selective, target-related fluctuations. The resulting lateralized gamma-band activity (LGA) showed opposite pre-target 4~Hz phases for detected versus missed targets. The 4~Hz phase of pre-target LGA accounted for a 14.5\% modulation in performance. These findings suggest that spatial attention is a theta-rhythmic sampling process that is continuously ongoing, with each sampling cycle being implemented through gamma-band synchrony.},

Pellicano and Burr (Trends Cogn Sci 16(10):504-10, 2012) have argued that these atypicalities might be explained within a Bayesian framework, in which perception represents the combination of sensory information with prior knowledge. They propose that the Bayesian priors of individuals with ASC might be attenuated, such that their perception is less reliant on prior knowledge than neurotypical individuals. An important tenet of Bayesian decision theory is that increased uncertainty about incoming sensory information will lead to a greater influence of the prior on perception. Consistent with this, Mareschal et al. (Curr Biol 23(8):717-21, 2013) showed that when noise is added to the eyes of a face (increasing uncertainty about gaze direction), gaze is more likely to be perceived as direct.},

  doi = {10.1167/15.12.1002},
  abstract = {It has been proposed that distinct forms of neural suppression occur at different stages of visual processing. At a single neuron level, monocular and dichoptic cross-channel masking have very different properties consistent with pre-cortical and cortical neural substrates respectively (Li, Peterson, Thompson, Duong \& Freeman, 2005, J Neurophysiol., 94: 1645-1650). Monocular cross-channel masking produces a lateral shift of the contrast response function (contrast gain) whereas dichoptic masking produces a multiplicative shift (response gain). We investigated how contrast response functions in human visual cortex are affected by four mask types: monocular and dichoptic cross-oriented (overlaid) masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks. We measured steady-state EEG responses at the occipital pole to 1c/deg target stimuli (contrasts 6-96\%) flickering at 5Hz with or without drifting masks of various contrasts. We interpret the results in the context of a Naka-Rushton model (resp=rCn/(Sn + Cn), where C is contrast) for which the response gain parameter (r), the saturation constant (S), or both parameters could be altered by the mask. All masks reduced target signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at high mask contrasts, with monocular overlay and aligned surround masks showing evidence of contrast gain shifts, and dichoptic and orthogonal surround masks consistent with changes in response gain. We also plotted target responses as a function of mask contrast, revealing a novel facilitatory effect of low contrast surround masks that can be explained within the normalization framework. At high mask contrasts there was clear saturation for surround and dichoptic masks above the noise floor, which was not apparent for monocular orthogonal masks. Saturating suppression is consistent with the mask signals having passed through a stage of nonlinear transduction before impacting the target signals. These results bridge single cell studies in animals and psychophysical work in humans in delineating distinct suppressive pathways in the early visual system.},

There are neurons in the brain whose activity is correlated with the perception and not the stimulus. Hence, perceptual rivalry provides a unique probe of cortical function and could possibly serve as a diagnostic tool for cognitive disorders such as autism. A mathematical model based on the known biology of the brain has been developed to account for perceptual rivalry when the stimulus is static. The basic model also accounts for other neural responses to stimuli that do not elicit rivalry. However, these models cannot explain illusions where the stimulus is intermittently switched on and off and the same perception returns after an off period because there is no built-in mechanism to hold the memory. Here, we show that the inclusion of experimentally observed low-level background neural activity is sufficient to explain rivalry for static inputs, and rivalry for intermittent inputs. We validate the model with new experiments.},

  abstract = {The perceptual organization of sound sequences into auditory streams involves the integration of sounds into one stream and the segregation of sounds into separate streams. ``Objective'' psychophysical measures of auditory streaming can be obtained using behavioral tasks where performance is facilitated by segregation and hampered by integration, or vice versa. Traditionally, these two types of tasks have been tested in separate studies involving different listeners, procedures, and stimuli. Here, we tested subjects in two complementary temporal-gap discrimination tasks involving similar stimuli and procedures. One task was designed so that performance in it would be facilitated by perceptual integration; the other, so that performance would be facilitated by perceptual segregation. Thresholds were measured in both tasks under a wide range of conditions produced by varying three stimulus parameters known to influence stream formation: frequency separation, tone-presentation rate, and sequence length. In addition to these performance-based measures, subjective judgments of perceived segregation were collected in the same listeners under corresponding stimulus conditions. The patterns of results obtained in the two temporal-discrimination tasks, and the relationships between thresholds and perceived-segregation judgments, were mostly consistent with the hypothesis that stream segregation helped performance in one task and impaired performance in the other task. The tasks and stimuli described here may prove useful in future behavioral or neurophysiological experiments, which seek to manipulate and measure neural correlates of auditory streaming while minimizing differences between the physical stimuli.},

Each child was presented with a series of neutral faces, virtual faces (avatars) and different objects, separated by black slides. We recorded the mean pupil size and pupil size changes over time in each of the three categories of stimuli and during exposure to the black slides. Fifty-seven children participated in study (19 ASD, mean age 118 months; 19 mental age-matched controls, mean age 87 months; and 19 chronological age-matched controls, mean age 118 months).

During the presentation of slides, the mean pupil size in the ASD group was clearly smaller than in the MA-matched and CA-matched groups. Discriminate analysis of pupil size during the presentation of black slides and slides with visual stimuli successfully predicted group membership in 72\% of the participants. Group membership was correctly classified in 89\% of the participants in the ASD group, in 63\% in the MA-matched group and in 63\% in the CA-matched group. These potential biomarkers may contribute to our understanding of the differences in neurological development in the brain in autism and could prove useful as indicators of ASD.},

Gamma-band (30\textendash{}90~Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8\textendash{}20~Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7\textendash{}8~Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Numerous psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with differences in visual perception, and it has been proposed that the treatment of these differences may represent a novel means to treat disorders like schizophrenia. Unfortunately, few methods exist to study visual perception in pre-clinical species.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to adapt a task of visual integration by proximity with relevance to schizophrenia to a rodent touchscreen environment to determine the effects of glutamatergic and GABAergic compounds. In this way, we could evaluate the effects of common models of cognitive impairment, as well as the effects of net excitation versus inhibition, on a task of visual integration.
METHOD: Rats were trained to perform a visual discrimination where the stimuli were composed of rows of dots differing only in there horizontal and vertical proximity. Once stable performance had been achieved, animals were tested under the influence of glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs (ketamine, MK-801, PCP, memantine, chlordiazepoxide, or diazepam) while attempting to perform a visual discrimination with altered stimuli.
RESULTS: Ketamine appeared to impair perceptual grouping in this paradigm, while the GABA agonist chlordiazepoxide enhanced grouping even in the presence of non-selective effects.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, these findings support the theory that NMDA antagonists may disrupt visual grouping by proximity and highlight a potential beneficial effect of enhanced GABA activity in perception. However, additional research will be required to confirm the stimulus selectivity of this effect, and the clinical significance of this approach.},

The effect of CBDV (1\textendash{}100\,$\mu$M) on epileptiform local field potentials (LFPs) induced in rat hippocampal brain slices by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) application or Mg2+-free conditions was assessed by in vitro multi-electrode array recordings. Additionally, the anticonvulsant profile of CBDV (50\textendash{}200\,mg$\cdot$kg-1) in vivo was investigated in four rodent seizure models: maximal electroshock (mES) and audiogenic seizures in mice, and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. The effects of CBDV in combination with commonly used antiepileptic drugs on rat seizures were investigated. Finally, the motor side effect profile of CBDV was investigated using static beam and grip strength assays.

Key Results

CBDV significantly attenuated status epilepticus-like epileptiform LFPs induced by 4-AP and Mg2+-free conditions. CBDV had significant anticonvulsant effects on the mES ($\geq$100\,mg$\cdot$kg-1), audiogenic ($\geq$50\,mg$\cdot$kg-1) and PTZ-induced seizures ($\geq$100\,mg$\cdot$kg-1). CBDV (200\,mg$\cdot$kg-1) alone had no effect against pilocarpine-induced seizures, but significantly attenuated these seizures when administered with valproate or phenobarbital at this dose. CBDV had no effect on motor function.

Conclusions and Implications

These results indicate that CBDV is an effective anticonvulsant in a broad range of seizure models. Also it did not significantly affect normal motor function and, therefore, merits further investigation as a novel anti-epileptic in chronic epilepsy models.

  abstract = {Two incongruent images viewed by the two eyes cause binocular rivalry, during which observers perceive continuous alternations between these two visual images. Previous studies in both humans and monkeys have shown that the primary visual cortex (V1) plays a critical role in the rivalry perception. However, it is unclear whether the rivalry activity observed in V1 relies on conscious influences. Here, we examine the responses of V1 in monkeys under general anesthesia. With intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-trial analysis, alternating activation of ocular dominance columns in V1 was observed during binocularly incongruent stimulation. Left- and right-eye columns exhibited counterphase activation, which were modulated by stimulus features in ways similar to those found in conscious human observers. These observations indicated that binocular rivalry occurs in V1 without consciousness, suggesting that the low-level automatic mechanisms play a more important role than previously believed in handling visual ambiguities.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When visual input is ambiguous, for example, in viewing bistable images, human subjects normally perceive one of the interpretations at a particular moment. Previous studies have shown that both low-level visual processing and high-level attention contribute to the establishment of the final visual perception. However, it is not clear whether attention is indispensable in such a process. Here we show that rivalry-like neural activity persisted in monkey V1 when the monkeys were anesthetized and viewed binocularly incongruent stimuli. Such activity has many key features similar to those observed in conscious human subjects. These findings indicate that low-level visual processes play a critical role in solving visual ambiguity such as binocular rivalry.},

  doi = {10.1089/can.2015.0004},
  abstract = {Introduction: In recent research, orally administered cannabidiol (CBD) showed a relatively high incidence of somnolence in a pediatric population. Previous work has suggested that when CBD is exposed to an acidic environment, it degrades to $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other psychoactive cannabinoids. To gain a better understanding of quantitative exposure, we completed an in vitro study by evaluating the formation of psychoactive cannabinoids when CBD is exposed to simulated gastric fluid (SGF). Methods: Materials included synthetic CBD, $\Delta$8-THC, and $\Delta$9-THC. Linearity was demonstrated for each component over the concentration range used in this study. CBD was spiked into media containing 1\% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Samples were analyzed using chromatography with UV and mass spectrometry detection. An assessment time of 3\,h was chosen as representative of the maximal duration of exposure to gastric fluid. Results: CBD in SGF with 1\% SDS was degraded about 85\% after 60\,min and more than 98\% at 120\,min. The degradation followed first-order kinetics at a rate constant of -0.031\,min-1 (R2=0.9933). The major products formed were $\Delta$9-THC and $\Delta$8-THC with less significant levels of other related cannabinoids. CBD in physiological buffer performed as a control did not convert to THC. Confirmation of THC formation was demonstrated by comparison of mass spectral analysis, mass identification, and retention time of $\Delta$9-THC and $\Delta$8-THC in the SGF samples against authentic reference standards. Conclusions: SGF converts CBD into the psychoactive components $\Delta$9-THC and $\Delta$8-THC. The first-order kinetics observed in this study allowed estimated levels to be calculated and indicated that the acidic environment during normal gastrointestinal transit can expose orally CBD-treated patients to levels of THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids that may exceed the threshold for a physiological response. Delivery methods that decrease the potential for formation of psychoactive cannabinoids should be explored.},

Recently, we observed decreased pupil responses to human faces in children with ASD. In the current study, we found differences in baseline (tonic) pupil size, with the ASD group exhibiting a larger pupil size than age-matched controls. Pupil responses are sensitive and reliable measures of ANS functioning, thus, this finding highlights the role of the ANS, and may provide clues about underlying neuropathology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Background
Previous studies have reported that peer groups are one of the most important predictors of adolescent and young adult marijuana use, and yet the neural correlates of social processing in marijuana users have not been studied.
Methods
In the current study, marijuana-using young adults (n = 20) and nonusing control subjects (n = 22) participated in a neuroimaging social exclusion task called Cyberball, a computerized ball-tossing game in which the participant is excluded from the game after a predetermined number of ball tosses.
Results
Control subjects, but not marijuana users, demonstrated significant activation in the insula, a region associated with negative emotion, when being excluded from the game. Both groups demonstrated activation of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, a region associated with affective monitoring, during peer exclusion. Only the marijuana group showed a correlation between ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation and scores on a self-report measure of peer conformity.
Conclusions
This study indicates that marijuana users show atypical neural processing of social exclusion. This differential activation may have preexisted and may have contributed to the onset of marijuana use, and/or it may have developed as a result of marijuana exposure.},

In Part 2, we explain how, given uncertain effect size estimates, well-powered studies can be designed with sequential analyses. In Part 3, we (a) explain what p values convey about the likelihood that an effect is true, (b) illustrate how the v statistic can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual studies, and (c) show how the evidential value of multiple studies can be examined with a p-curve analysis. We end by discussing the consequences of incorporating our recommendations in terms of a reduced quantity, but increased quality, of the research output.

In particular, an essential feature of the phenomenon, which corresponds to the fact that the segregation of sounds into streams typically takes several seconds to build up, remains unexplained. Here, we show that this and other major features of auditory-stream formation measured in humans using alternating-tone sequences can be quantitatively accounted for based on single-unit responses recorded in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake rhesus monkeys listening to the same sound sequences.},

  doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00489},
  abstract = {Binocular rivalry refers to perceptual alternation when two eyes view different images. One of the potential percepts during binocular rivalry is a spatial mosaic of left- and right-eye images, known as piecemeal percepts, which may result from localized rivalries between small regions in the left- and right-eye images. It is known that alcohol increases inhibitory neurotransmission, which may reduce the number of alternations during binocular rivalry. However, it is unclear whether alcohol affects rivalry dynamics in the same manner for both coherent percepts (i.e. percepts of complete left or right images) and piecemeal percepts. To address this question, the present study measured the dynamics of binocular rivalry before and after 15 moderate-to-heavy social drinkers consumed an intoxicating dose of alcohol versus a placebo beverage. Both simple rivalrous stimuli consisting of gratings with different orientations, and complex stimuli consisting of a face or a house were tested to examine alcohol effects on rivalry as a function of stimulus complexity. Results showed that for both simple and complex stimuli, alcohol affects coherent and piecemeal percepts differently. More specifically, alcohol reduced the number of coherent percepts but not the mean dominance duration of coherent percepts. In contrast, for piecemeal percepts, alcohol increased the mean dominance duration but not the number of piecemeal percepts.  These results suggested that alcohol drinking may selectively affect the dynamics of transitional period of binocular rivalry by increasing the duration of piecemeal percepts, leading a reduction in the number of coherent percepts. The differential effect of alcohol on the dynamics of coherent and piecemeal percepts cannot be accounted for by alcohol's effect on a common inhibitory mechanism. Other mechanisms, such as increasing neural noise, are needed to explain alcohol's effect on the dynamics of binocular rivalry.},

Furthermore, the asymmetry of masking at the sensory level, when all sources of processing interference are eliminated, can be explained in terms of the falloff in acuity from the center to the periphery of the retina. The sensory component of masking is asymmetrical because, with the target at a constant retinal location, the target-plus-mask configuration is, as a whole, more peripherally located with a peripheral mask than a central one, and it is the location of the target-plus-mask configuration that determines performance.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers to examine whether $\Delta$-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on regional brain function. We then assessed whether pretreatment with CBD can prevent the acute psychotic symptoms induced by $\Delta$-9-THC. Fifteen healthy men with minimal earlier exposure to cannabis were scanned while performing a verbal memory task, a response inhibition task, a sensory processing task, and when viewing fearful faces. Subjects were scanned on three occasions, each preceded by oral administration of $\Delta$-9-THC, CBD, or placebo. BOLD responses were measured using fMRI. In a second experiment, six healthy volunteers were administered $\Delta$-9-THC intravenously on two occasions, after placebo or CBD pretreatment to examine whether CBD could block the psychotic symptoms induced by $\Delta$-9-THC. $\Delta$-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the striatum during verbal recall, in the hippocampus during the response inhibition task, in the amygdala when subjects viewed fearful faces, in the superior temporal cortex when subjects listened to speech, and in the occipital cortex during visual processing. In the second experiment, pretreatment with CBD prevented the acute induction of psychotic symptoms by $\Delta$-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. $\Delta$-9-THC and CBD can have opposite effects on regional brain function, which may underlie their different symptomatic and behavioral effects, and CBD's ability to block the psychotogenic effects of $\Delta$-9-THC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To provide access to cannabidiol (CBD) for children with medication resistant epilepsy (MRE) and evaluate CBD as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment with respect to the percentage change from baseline in seizure frequency. BACKGROUND The State of Georgia desires to provide children with MRE access to CBD and contribute to the scientific literature on CBD. DESIGN/METHODS This multi-center study for MRE patients 1 to 18 years of age at time of enrollment consists of 8 week baseline, titration, and treatment periods with CBD up to a 25 mg/kg/day dosage. Treatment will be provided for 52 weeks. The patient or caregiver records seizure frequency and drug compliance into an innovative electronic diary application. Statistical analyses were calculated for relevant median overall seizure frequency reduction from baseline. RESULTS As of 9/30/2015, total enrollment was 46 patients, of which, 20 [average age 9.6 yrs, range 1 to 17 yrs, male (n=11)], received at least 8-weeks of treatment for the analysis below. The common underlying causes of epilepsy were cryptogenic (n=10; 50[percnt]) and cortical dysplasia (n=5; 26[percnt]). The average number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range= 2-5). Four patients had a history of epilepsy surgery (i.e. corpus callosotomy, cortical resection). After eight weeks of treatment, 95[percnt] of patients experienced seizure frequency reduction from baseline. Overall, reduction in total seizure frequency for all patients was 51[percnt] with a 48[percnt] reduction in all types of major seizures (tonic, atonic, and generalized tonic clonic). Adverse events in 10[percnt] of patients (n=2) included somnolence (n=1), ataxia (n=1), and vomiting (n=2). One patient withdrew primarily due to lack of efficacy. No related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported. CONCLUSIONS These results show that CBD may be a promising treatment for MRE and is generally well-tolerated in doses up to 25mg/kg/day.

  abstract = {Binocular rivalry arises when incompatible images are presented to the two eyes. If the two eyes' conflicting features are invisible, leading to identical perceptual interpretations, does rivalry competition still occur? Here we investigated whether binocular rivalry can be induced from conflicting but invisible spatial patterns. A chromatic grating counterphase flickering at 30 Hz appeared uniform, but produced significant tilt aftereffect and orientation-selective adaptation. The invisible pattern also generated significant BOLD activities in the early visual cortex, with minimal response in the parietal and frontal cortical areas. Compared with perceptually matched uniform stimuli, a monocularly presented invisible chromatic grating enhanced the rivalry competition with a low-contrast visible grating presented to the other eye. Furthermore, switching from a uniform field to a perceptually matched invisible chromatic grating produced interocular suppression at approximately 200 ms after onset of the invisible grating. Experiments using briefly presented monocular probes revealed evidence for sustained rivalry competition between two invisible gratings during continuous dichoptic presentations. These findings indicate that even without visible interocular conflict, and with minimal engagement of frontoparietal cortex and consciousness related top-down feedback, perceptually identical patterns with invisible conflict features produce rivalry competition in the early visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Purpose:

To evaluate an alternative method for generating multibanded radiofrequency (RF) pulses for use in multiband slice-accelerated imaging with slice-GRAPPA unaliasing, substantially reducing the required peak power without bandwidth compromises. This allows much higher accelerations for spin-echo methods such as SE-fMRI and diffusion-weighted MRI where multibanded slice acceleration has been limited by available peak power.

Theory and Methods:

Multibanded ``time-shifted'' RF pulses were generated by inserting temporal shifts between the applications of RF energy for individual bands, avoiding worst-case constructive interferences. Slice profiles and images in phantoms and human subjects were acquired at 3 T.

Results:

For typical sinc pulses, time-shifted multibanded RF pulses were generated with little increase in required peak power compared to single-banded pulses. Slice profile quality was improved by allowing for higher pulse bandwidths, and image quality was improved by allowing for optimum flip angles to be achieved.

Conclusion:

A simple approach has been demonstrated that significantly alleviates the restrictions imposed on achievable slice acceleration factors in multiband spin-echo imaging due to the power requirements of multibanded RF pulses. This solution will allow for increased accelerations in diffusion-weighted MRI applications where data acquisition times are normally very long and the ability to accelerate is extremely valuable.

  abstract = {Although different features of an object are processed in anatomically distinct regions of the cerebral cortex, they often appear bound together in perception. Here, using binocular rivalry, we reveal that the awareness of form can occur independently from the awareness of colour. First, we report that, if both eyes briefly view a grating stimulus prior to the presentation of the same grating in one eye and an orthogonal grating in the other, subjects tend to report perceptual dominance of the non-primed grating. The primer was most effective when it was similar in orientation, spatial frequency and spatial phase to one of the rival images. Next, we showed that the process underlying the binocular integration of chromatic information was selectively influenced by the colour of a previously presented stimulus. We then combined these paradigms by using a primer that had the same colour as one rival stimulus, but the same form as the other stimulus. In this situation, we found that rival stimuli differing in form and colour can sometimes achieve states of dominance in which the chromatic information from one eye's image combines with the form of the other eye's image temporarily creating a binocular impression that corresponds with neither monocular component. Finally, we demonstrated that during continuous viewing of rival stimuli differing in form and colour, chromatic integration could occur independently of form rivalry. Paradoxically, however, we found that changes to the form of the stimulus had more of an influence on chromatic integration than on form rivalry. Together these phenomena show that the neural processes involved in integrating information from the two eyes can operate selectively on different stimulus features.},

Here, using an adaptation paradigm, we explore the initial mechanisms involved in selecting a stimulus for perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry. When one or both eyes briefly viewed an adapting grating stimulus prior to the presentation of the adapting grating to one eye and an orthogonal, non-adapted grating to the other eye, participants more often reported perceptual dominance of the non-adapted grating. Crowding reduced awareness of the adapting grating. On trials in which subjects were unaware of the orientation of the adaptor grating, there was no effect of the adaptor on perceived dominance during rivalry; participants were just as likely to report dominance of the adapted or non-adapted grating.

  abstract = {In everyday life, temporal information is used for both perception and action, but whether these two functions reflect the operation of similar or different neural circuits is unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of processing temporal information when either a motor or a perceptual representation is used. Participants viewed two identical sequences of visual stimuli and used the information differently to perform either a temporal reproduction or a temporal estimation task. By comparing brain activity evoked by these tasks and control conditions, we explored commonalities and differences in brain areas involved in reproduction and estimation of temporal intervals. The basal ganglia and the cerebellum were commonly active in both temporal tasks, consistent with suggestions that perception and production of time are subserved by the same mechanisms. However, only in the reproduction task was activity observed in a wider cortical network including the right pre-SMA, left middle frontal gyrus, left premotor cortex, with a more reliable activity in the right inferior parietal cortex, left fusiform gyrus, and the right extrastriate visual area V5/MT. Our findings point to a role for the parietal cortex as an interface between sensory and motor processes and suggest that it may be a key node in translation of temporal information into action. Furthermore, we discuss the potential importance of the extrastriate cortex in processing visual time in the context of recent findings.},

  abstract = {Background
Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of information across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics.
Methods
Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) were presented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments.
Results
Patients had reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r = .32, p \&lt;.01).
Conclusions
Schizophrenia patients have frequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.},

  abstract = {Background
The early visual-evoked gamma oscillation (VGO) elicited by Gestalt stimuli is reduced in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy individuals, but it is unknown whether this effect is specific to these particular stimuli and task. In contrast, the early auditory-evoked gamma oscillation (AGO) was reported to be unaffected in a sample of unmedicated, mostly first-episode schizophrenics, but it is unknown whether this oscillation is abnormal in chronic, medicated patients. We investigated these issues by examining the VGO and AGO in chronic schizophrenic (SZ) and matched healthy control (HC) subjects.
Methods
Subjects (21 HC, 23 SZ) performed visual and auditory oddball tasks. Visual stimuli were letters, and auditory stimuli were simple tones. Event-related spectral measures (phase locking factor and evoked power) were computed on Morlet wavelet-transformed single epochs from the standard trials.
Results
VGO phase locking at occipital electrodes was reduced in SZ compared with HC. In contrast, AGO phase locking and evoked power did not differ between groups.
Conclusions
The VGO deficit may be a general phenomenon in schizophrenia, whereas the AGO evoked by simple tone stimuli does not appear to be abnormal in chronic, medicated schizophrenia patients.},

In patients with schizophrenia, the synchronization of beta- and gamma-band activity is abnormal, suggesting a crucial role for dysfunctional oscillations in the generation of the cognitive deficits and other symptoms of the disorder. Dysfunctional oscillations may arise owing to anomalies in the brain's rhythm-generating networks of GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) interneurons and in cortico-cortical connections.},

  abstract = {Background Detection of visual contours (strings of small oriented elements) is markedly poor in schizophrenia. This has previously been attributed to an inability to group local information across space into a global percept. Here, we show that this failure actually originates from a combination of poor encoding of local orientation and abnormal processing of visual context.   Methods We measured the ability of observers with schizophrenia to localise contours embedded in backgrounds of differently oriented elements (either randomly oriented, near-parallel or near-perpendicular to the contour). In addition, we measured patients' ability to process local orientation information (i.e., report the orientation of an individual element) for both isolated and crowded elements (i.e., presented with nearby distractors).   Results While patients are poor at detecting contours amongst randomly oriented elements, they are proportionally less disrupted (compared to unaffected controls) when contour and surrounding elements have similar orientations (near-parallel condition). In addition, patients are poor at reporting the orientation of an individual element but, again, are less prone to interference from nearby distractors, a phenomenon known as visual crowding.   Conclusions We suggest that patients' poor performance at contour perception arises not as a consequence of an ``integration deficit'' but from a combination of reduced sensitivity to local orientation and abnormalities in contextual processing. We propose that this is a consequence of abnormal gain control, a phenomenon that has been implicated in orientation-selectivity as well as surround suppression.},

These data provide further evidence for impaired perceptual grouping in schizophrenia.

To examine the generality of this phenomenon we measured the ability of 24 individuals with schizophrenia to judge the luminance, contrast, orientation and size of targets embedded in contextual surrounds that would typically influence the target's appearance. Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated weaker surround suppression compared to matched controls for stimuli defined by contrast or size, but not for those defined by luminance or orientation. As perceived luminance is thought to be regulated at the earliest stages of visual processing our findings are consistent with a suppression deficit that is predominantly cortical in origin. In addition, we propose that preserved orientation surround suppression in schizophrenia may reflect the sparing of broadly tuned mechanisms of suppression.

Here we hypothesized that sensory processing of information in the visual periphery would be impaired in schizophrenia patients and, as a result, crowding \textendash{} the breakdown in target recognition that occurs in cluttered visual environments \textendash{} would be stronger. Therefore, we assessed visual crowding in the peripheral vision of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Subjects were asked to identify a target letter that was surrounded by distracter letters of similar appearance. Targets and distracters were displayed at 8$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ of visual angle from the fixation point (eccentricity), and target-distracter spacing was 2$^\circ$, 3$^\circ$, 4$^\circ$, 5$^\circ$, 6$^\circ$, 7$^\circ$ or 8$^\circ$ of visual angle. Eccentricity and target-distracter spacing were randomly varied. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of correctly identified targets. Critical spacing was defined as the spacing at which target identification accuracy began to deteriorate, and was assessed at viewing eccentricities of 8$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$. Schizophrenia patients were less accurate and showed a larger critical spacing than healthy individuals. These results indicate that crowding is stronger and sensory processing of information in the visual periphery is impaired in schizophrenia. This is in line with previous reports of preferential magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia. Thus, deficits in peripheral vision may account for perceptual alterations and contribute to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

We investigated contextual processing abnormalities across a comprehensive set of visual tasks. For perception of luminance, size, contrast, orientation, and motion, we quantified the degree to which the surrounding visual context altered a center stimulus's appearance. Healthy participants showed robust contextual effects across all tasks, as evidenced by pronounced misperceptions of center stimuli. Schizophrenia patients exhibited intact contextual modulations of luminance and size but showed weakened contextual modulations of contrast, performing more accurately than controls. Strong motion and orientation context effects correlated with worse symptoms and social functioning. Importantly, the overall strength of contextual modulation across tasks did not differ between controls and schizophrenia patients. In addition, performance measures across contextual tasks were uncorrelated, implying discrete underlying processes. These findings reveal that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia is selective, arguing against the proposed unitary contextual processing dysfunction.},

Patients showed decreased contrast sensitivity to magnocellular-biased stimuli (\emph{P}\&lt;.001). Evoked potential deficits were significantly related to decreased white matter integrity in the optic radiations (\emph{P}\&lt;.03). Evoked potential deficits predicted impaired contrast sensitivity (\emph{P} = .002), which was in turn related to deficits in complex visual processing (\emph{P}$\leq$.04).

  abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain essentially unknown. The GABA hypothesis proposes that reduced neuronal GABA concentration and neurotransmission results in cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, few in vivo studies have directly examined this hypothesis. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high field to measure visual cortical GABA levels in 13 subjects with schizophrenia and 13 demographically matched healthy control subjects. We found that the schizophrenia group had an $\sim$10\% reduction in GABA concentration. We further tested the GABA hypothesis by examining the relationship between visual cortical GABA levels and orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS), a behavioral measure of visual inhibition thought to be dependent on GABAergic synaptic transmission. Previous work has shown that subjects with schizophrenia exhibit reduced OSSS of contrast discrimination (Yoon et al., 2009). For subjects with both MRS and OSSS data (n = 16), we found a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.76) between these variables. GABA concentration was not correlated with overall contrast discrimination performance for stimuli without a surround (r = -0.10). These results suggest that a neocortical GABA deficit in subjects with schizophrenia leads to impaired cortical inhibition and that GABAergic synaptic transmission in visual cortex plays a critical role in OSSS.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.visres.2017.02.001},
  abstract = {When distinct stimuli are presented to the two eyes, their mental representations alternate in awareness. Here, such "binocular rivalry" was used to investigate whether audio-visual associations bias visual perception. To induce two arbitrary associations, each between a tone and a grating of a specific color and motion direction, observers were required to respond whenever this combination was presented, but not for other tone-grating combinations. After about 20min of this induction phase, each of the gratings was presented to one eye to induce rivalry, while either of the two tones or no tone was played. Observers were asked to watch the rivaling stimuli and listen to the tones. The observer's dominant percept was assessed throughout by measuring the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), whose slow phase follows the direction of the currently dominant grating. We found that perception in rivalry was affected by the concurrently played tone. Results suggest a bias towards the grating that had been associated with the concurrently presented tone and prolonged dominance durations for this grating compared to the other. Numerically, conditions without tone fell in-between for measures of bias and dominance duration. Our data show that a rapidly acquired arbitrary audio-visual association biases visual perception. Unlike previously reported cross-modal interactions in rivalry, this effect can neither be explained by a pure attentional (dual-task) effect, nor does it require a fixed physical or semantic relation between the auditory and visual stimulus. This suggests that audio-visual associations that are quickly formed by associative learning may affect visual representations directly.},

  abstract = {Previous workers have studied the optic nerve of the eel's eye and single fibers in that of Limulus. In this study the cold-blooded vertebrate optic nerve fiber was used (mostly bull frog). Potentials from small bundles dissected off the anterior surface of the retina were recorded by amplifier and oscillograph. Three types of response were shown by different fibers: (1) a discharge during the total light period, by 20\% of the fibers; (2) an "on" and an "off" effect only, by 50\%; (3) a vigorous "off" effect only, by 30\%. Latency, frequency, and intensity of "on" and "off" responses were related to stimulus intensity and duration in expected fashion. Similar results were obtained from fish, amphibian and reptilian eyes. The response from a fiber was obtained by stimulation of a definitely restricted location on the retina, but the type of response was not dependent on a given location. It is suggested that the type of response is probably not a function of rod and cone characteristics. It may be the result of a balance of inhibitory and excitatory effects on the ganglion cell or the result of functional differences among ganglion cells.},

However, perceptual functions are frequently disrupted in schizophrenia, and thus this domain has been included in the CNTRICS (Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) project. In this article, we describe the basic science presentation and the breakout group discussion on the topic of perception from the first CNTRICS meeting, held in Bethesda, Maryland on February 26 and 27, 2007. The importance of perceptual dysfunction in schizophrenia, the nature of perceptual abnormalities in this disorder, and the critical need to develop perceptual tests appropriate for future clinical trials were discussed. Although deficits are also seen in auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory processing in schizophrenia, the first CNTRICS meeting focused on visual processing deficits. Key concepts of gain control and integration in visual perception were introduced. Definitions and examples of these concepts are provided in this article. Use of visual gain control and integration fit a number of the criteria suggested by the CNTRICS committee, provide fundamental constructs for understanding the visual system in schizophrenia, and are inclusive of both lower-level and higher-level perceptual deficits.},

  abstract = {The Gestalt law of ``good continuation'' has been used to describe a variety of phenomena demonstrating the importance of continuity in human perception. In this study, we consider how continuity may be represented by a visual system that filters spatial data using arrays of cells selective for orientation and spatial frequency. Many structures (e.g. fractal contours) show a form of redundancy which is well represented by the continuity of features as they vary across space and frequency. We suggest that it is possible to take advantage of the redundancy in continuous, but non-aligned features by associating the outputs of filters with similar tuning. Five experiments were performed, to determine the rules that govern the perception of continuity. Observers were presented with arrays of oriented, band-pass elements (Gabor patches) in which a subset of the elements was aligned along a ``jagged'' path. Using a forced-choice procedure, observers were found to be capable of identifying the path within a field of randomly-oriented elements even when the spacing between the elements was considerably larger than the size of any of the individual elements. Furthermore, when the elements were oriented at angles up to $\pm$ 60 deg relative to one another, the path was reliably identified. Alignment of the elements along the path was found to play a large role in the ability to detect the path. Small variations in the alignment or aligning the elements orthogonally (i.e. ``side-to-side'' as opposed to ``end-to-end'') significantly reduced the observer's ability to detect the presence of a path. The results are discussed in terms of an ``association field'' which integrates information across neighboring filters tuned to similar orientations. We suggest that some of the processes involved in texture segregation may have a similar explanation.},
